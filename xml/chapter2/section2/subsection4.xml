  <TEXT>
    This section presents a simple language for drawing pictures that
    illustrates the power of data abstraction and closure, and also exploits
    higher-order
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    in an essential way.  The language is designed to make it easy to
    experiment with patterns such as the ones in
    figure<SPACE/><REF NAME="fig:sqlimit-designs"/>, which are composed of
    repeated elements that are shifted and scaled.<FOOTNOTE>The picture
    language is based on the language
    <INDEX>Henderson, Peter</INDEX>
    Peter Henderson created to construct images like
    <INDEX>Escher, Maurits Cornelis</INDEX>
    M.C. Escher<APOS/>s <QUOTE>Square Limit</QUOTE> woodcut (see
    <CITATION>Henderson 1982</CITATION>). The woodcut incorporates a repeated
    scaled pattern, similar to the arrangements drawn using the

  </SUBHEADING>

  <TEXT>
    When we began our study of programming in
    section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:elements-of-programming"/>, we emphasized the
    importance of describing a language by focusing on the language<APOS/>s
    primitives, its means of combination, and its means of abstraction.
    We<APOS/>ll follow that framework here.
  </TEXT>

  <TEXT>
    Part of the elegance of this picture language is that there is only one
    kind of element, called a
    <INDEX>painter(s)</INDEX>
    <EM>painter</EM>.  A painter draws an image that is shifted and scaled to
    fit within a designated
    <INDEX>frame (picture language)</INDEX>
    parallelogram-shaped frame.  For example, there<APOS/>s a primitive painter
    we<APOS/>ll call <SCHEMEINLINE>wave</SCHEMEINLINE>
    that makes a crude line drawing,
    as shown in figure<SPACE/><REF NAME="fig:wave"/>.
    <FIGURE src="img_original/Fig2.10.std.svg">
      <LABEL NAME="fig:wave"/>
      <CAPTION>Images produced by the <SCHEMEINLINE>wave</SCHEMEINLINE>
      painter, with respect to four different frames.  The frames, shown
      with dotted lines, are not part of the images.

    The actual shape of the drawing depends on the frame<EMDASH/>all four
    images in figure<SPACE/><REF NAME="fig:wave"/> are produced by the same
    <SCHEMEINLINE>wave</SCHEMEINLINE> painter, but with respect to four
    different frames. Painters can be more elaborate than this: The primitive
    painter called <SCHEMEINLINE>rogers</SCHEMEINLINE> paints a picture of
    MIT<APOS/>s founder, William Barton Rogers, as shown in
    figure<SPACE/><REF NAME="fig:rogers"/>.<FOOTNOTE>
    <INDEX>MIT<SUBINDEX>early history of</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
    <INDEX>Rogers, William Barton</INDEX>
      William Barton Rogers (1804<ENDASH/>1882) was the founder and first
      president of MIT.  A geologist and talented teacher, he taught at
      William and Mary College and at the University of Virginia.  In 1859
      he moved to Boston, where he had more time for research, worked on a
      plan for establishing a <QUOTE>polytechnic institute,</QUOTE> and
      served as Massachusetts<APOS/>s first State Inspector of Gas Meters.
      <TEXT>
      When MIT was established in 1861, Rogers was elected its first
      president. Rogers espoused an ideal of <QUOTE>useful learning</QUOTE>
      that was different from the university education of the time, with its
      overemphasis on the classics, which, as he wrote, <QUOTE>stand in the
      way of the broader, higher and more practical instruction and
      discipline of the natural and social sciences.</QUOTE>  This
      education was likewise to be different from narrow trade-school
      education.  In Rogers<APOS/>s words:
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        The world-enforced distinction between the practical and the
        scientific worker is utterly futile, and the whole experience of
        modern times has demonstrated its utter worthlessness.
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      </TEXT>
      <TEXT>
      Rogers served as president of MIT until 1870, when he resigned due to
      ill health.  In 1878 the second president of MIT,
      <INDEX>Runkle, John Daniel</INDEX>
      John Runkle, resigned under the pressure of a financial crisis
      brought on by the Panic of 1873 and strain of fighting off attempts
      by Harvard to take over MIT.  Rogers returned to hold the office of
      president until 1881.
      </TEXT>
      <TEXT>
      Rogers collapsed and died while addressing MIT<APOS/>s graduating
      class at the commencement exercises of 1882.  Runkle quoted
      Rogers<APOS/>s last words in a memorial address delivered that same
      year:
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <QUOTE>As I stand here today and see what the Institute is, <ELLIPSIS/><SPACE/>I call
        to mind the beginnings of science.  I remember one hundred and fifty
        years ago Stephen Hales published a pamphlet on the subject of
        illuminating gas, in which he stated that his researches had
        demonstrated that 128 grains of bituminous coal<EMDASH/></QUOTE>
        <P>
          <INDEX>coal, bituminous</INDEX>
          <QUOTE>Bituminous coal,</QUOTE> these were his last words on
	  earth.  Here he bent forward, as if consulting some notes on the
	  table before him, then slowly regaining an erect position, threw
	  up his hands, and was translated from the scene of his earthly
	  labors and triumphs to <QUOTE>the tomorrow of death,</QUOTE>
	  where the mysteries of life are solved, and the disembodied
	  spirit finds unending satisfaction in contemplating the new and
	  still unfathomable mysteries of the infinite future.

      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      In the words of  Francis A. Walker
      <INDEX>Walker, Francis Amasa</INDEX>
      (MIT<APOS/>s third president):
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        All his life he had borne himself most faithfully and heroically,
	and he died as so good a knight would surely have wished, in
	harness, at his post, and in the very part and act of public duty.

    The four images in figure<SPACE/><REF NAME="fig:rogers"/>
    are drawn with respect to the same four frames
    as the <SCHEMEINLINE>wave</SCHEMEINLINE> images in

  <TEXT>
    To combine images, we use various
    <INDEX>painter(s)<SUBINDEX>operations</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
    operations that construct new painters
    from given painters. For example, the
     <INDEX><USE>beside</USE></INDEX> 
    <SCHEMEINLINE>beside</SCHEMEINLINE> operation takes two painters and
    produces a new, compound painter that draws the first painter<APOS/>s image
    in the left half of the frame and the second painter<APOS/>s image in the
    right half of the frame. Similarly,
     <INDEX><USE>below</USE></INDEX> 
    <SCHEMEINLINE>below</SCHEMEINLINE> takes two painters and produces a
    compound painter that draws the first painter<APOS/>s image below the
    second painter<APOS/>s image. Some operations transform a single painter
    to produce a new painter.  For example,
     <INDEX><USE>flip_vert</USE></INDEX> 
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>flip-vert</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>flip_vert</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    takes a painter and produces a painter that draws its image upside-down, and
     <INDEX><USE>flip_horiz</USE></INDEX> 
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>flip-horiz</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>flip_horiz</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    produces a painter that draws the original painter<APOS/>s image
    left-to-right reversed.

    In building up a complex image in this manner we are exploiting the fact
    that painters are
    <INDEX>closure<SUBINDEX><ORDER>closurepict</ORDER>closure property of picture-language operations</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
    closed under the language<APOS/>s means of combination.
    The <SCHEMEINLINE>beside</SCHEMEINLINE> or
    <SCHEMEINLINE>below</SCHEMEINLINE> of two painters is itself a painter;
    therefore, we can use it as an element in making more complex painters.
    As with building up list structure using
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>cons</SCHEMEINLINE>,</SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>pair</JAVASCRIPTINLINE>,</JAVASCRIPT>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    the closure of our data under the means of combination is crucial to the
    ability to create complex structures while using only a few operations.

  <TEXT>
    Once we can combine painters, we would like to be able to abstract typical
    patterns of combining painters. We will implement the painter operations as

      <SCHEME>Scheme procedures.</SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT>JavaScript functions.</JAVASCRIPT>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    This means that we don<APOS/>t need a special abstraction mechanism in the

    In addition to abstracting patterns of combining painters, we can work at a
    higher level, abstracting patterns of combining painter operations. That
    is, we can view the painter operations as elements to manipulate and can
    write means of combination for these

    <EM>frame coordinate map</EM>, which will be used to shift and scale images

    <NAME>Levels of language for robust design</NAME>

  <TEXT>
    The picture language exercises some of the critical ideas we<APOS/>ve
    introduced about abstraction with
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    and data.  The fundamental data abstractions, painters, are implemented
    using
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME>
        procedural
      </SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT>
        functional
      </JAVASCRIPT>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    representations, which enables the language to handle different basic
    drawing capabilities in a uniform way.  The means of combination satisfy
    the closure property, which permits us to easily build up complex designs.
    Finally, all the tools for abstracting
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    are available to us for abstracting means of combination for painters.
  </TEXT>

  <TEXT>
    We have also obtained a glimpse of another crucial idea about languages and
    program design.  This is the approach of
    <INDEX>stratified design</INDEX>
    <INDEX>design, stratified</INDEX>
    <EM>stratified design</EM>, the notion that a complex system should be
    structured as a sequence of levels that are described using a sequence of
    languages. Each level is constructed by combining parts that are regarded
    as primitive at that level, and the parts constructed at each level are
    used as primitives at the next level.  The language used at each level
    of a stratified design has primitives, means of combination, and means
    of abstraction appropriate to that level of detail.
  </TEXT>

  <TEXT>
    Stratified design pervades the engineering of complex systems.  For
    example, in computer engineering, resistors and transistors are
    combined (and described using a language of analog circuits) to
    produce parts such as and-gates and or-gates, which form the
    primitives of a language for digital-circuit design.<FOOTNOTE>
    Section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:circuit-simulator"/> describes one such
    language.</FOOTNOTE> These parts are combined to build
    processors, bus structures, and memory systems, which are in turn
    combined to form computers, using languages appropriate to computer
    architecture.  Computers are combined to form distributed systems,
    using languages appropriate for describing network interconnections,
    and so on.
  </TEXT>

  <TEXT>
    As a tiny example of stratification, our picture language uses primitive
    elements (primitive painters) that specify points and lines to provide the
    shapes of a painter like <SCHEMEINLINE>rogers</SCHEMEINLINE>. The bulk of
    our description of the picture language focused on combining these
    primitives, using geometric combiners such as
    <SCHEMEINLINE>beside</SCHEMEINLINE> and <SCHEMEINLINE>below</SCHEMEINLINE>.
    We also worked at a higher level, regarding
    <SCHEMEINLINE>beside</SCHEMEINLINE> and <SCHEMEINLINE>below</SCHEMEINLINE>
    as primitives to be manipulated in a language whose operations, such as
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>square-of-four</SCHEMEINLINE>,</SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>square_of_four</JAVASCRIPTINLINE>,
      </JAVASCRIPT>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    capture common patterns of combining geometric combiners.
  </TEXT>

  <TEXT>
    Stratified design helps make programs
    <INDEX>robustness</INDEX>
    <EM>robust</EM>, that is, it makes
    it likely that small changes in a specification will require
    correspondingly small changes in the program.  For instance, suppose we
    wanted to change the image based on <SCHEMEINLINE>wave</SCHEMEINLINE>
    shown in figure<SPACE/><REF NAME="fig:sqlimit-designs"/>.  We could work
    at the lowest level to change the detailed appearance of the
    <SCHEMEINLINE>wave</SCHEMEINLINE> element; we could work at the middle
    level to change the way
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>corner-split</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>corner_split</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    replicates the <SCHEMEINLINE>wave</SCHEMEINLINE>; we could work at the
    highest level to change how
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>square-limit</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>square_limit</JAVASCRIPTINLINE>
      </JAVASCRIPT>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    arranges the four copies of the corner. In general, each level of a
    stratified design provides a different vocabulary for expressing the
    characteristics of the system, and a different kind of ability to change it.
