    As we saw in section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:benefits-of-assignment"/>, one of
    the major benefits of introducing assignment is that we can increase the
    modularity of our systems by encapsulating, or <QUOTE>hiding,</QUOTE> parts
    of the state of a large system within local variables.  Stream models can
    provide an equivalent modularity without the use of assignment.  As an
    illustration, we can reimplement the

    Let us now return to the issues of objects and state that were raised
    at the beginning of this chapter and examine them in a new light.  We
    introduced assignment and mutable objects to provide a mechanism for
    modular construction of programs that model systems with state.
    We constructed computational objects with local state variables and used
    assignment to modify these variables.  We modeled the temporal behavior of
    the objects in the world by the temporal behavior of the corresponding
    computational objects.
  </TEXT>

  <TEXT>
    Now we have seen that streams provide an alternative way to model
    objects with local state.  We can model a changing quantity, such as
    the local state of some object, using a stream that represents the
    time history of successive states.  In essence, we represent time
    explicitly, using streams, so that we decouple time in our simulated
    world from the sequence of events that take place during evaluation.
    Indeed, because of the presence of
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME>
	<SCHEMEINLINE>delay</SCHEMEINLINE>
      </SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT>
	delayed evaluation
      </JAVASCRIPT>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    there may be little relation between simulated time in the model and the
    order of events during the evaluation.
  </TEXT>

  <TEXT>
    In order to contrast these two approaches to modeling, let us
    reconsider the implementation of a <QUOTE>withdrawal processor</QUOTE> that
    monitors the balance in a
    <INDEX>bank account<SUBINDEX>stream model</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
    bank account.  In
    section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:costs-of-assignment"/> we implemented a

    From the point of view of one part of a complex process, the other parts
    appear to change with time.  They have hidden time-varying local state.  If
    we wish to write programs that model this kind of natural decomposition in
    our world (as we see it from our viewpoint as a part of that world) with
    structures in our computer, we make computational objects that are not
    functional<EMDASH/>they must change with time.  We model state with local
    state variables, and we model the changes of state with assignments to
    those variables.  By doing this we make the time of execution of a
    computation model time in the world that we are part of, and thus we
    get <QUOTE>objects</QUOTE> in our computer.
  </TEXT>

  <TEXT>
    Modeling with objects is powerful and intuitive, largely because this
    matches the perception of interacting with a world of which we are
    part.  However, as we<APOS/>ve seen repeatedly throughout this chapter,
    these models raise thorny problems of constraining the order of events
    and of synchronizing multiple processes.  The possibility of avoiding
    these problems has stimulated the development of

    On the other hand, if we look closely, we can see time-related problems
    creeping into functional models as well.  One particularly troublesome area
    arises when we wish to design interactive systems, especially ones that
    model interactions between independent entities. For instance, consider once
    more the implementation a banking system that permits joint bank accounts.
    In a conventional system using assignment and objects, we would model the
    fact that Peter and Paul share an account by having both Peter and Paul send
    their transaction requests to the same bank-account object, as we saw in
    section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:costs-of-assignment"/>. From the stream point
    of view, where there are no <QUOTE>objects</QUOTE> <EM>per se</EM>, we have
    already indicated that a bank account can be modeled as a process that
    operates on a stream of transaction requests to produce a stream of
    responses.  Accordingly, we could model the fact that Peter and Paul have a
    joint bank account by merging Peter<APOS/>s stream of transaction requests
    with Paul<APOS/>s stream of requests and feeding the result to the
    bank-account stream process, as shown in
    figure<SPACE/><REF NAME="fig:joint-account-stream"/>.

  <TEXT>
    The trouble with this formulation is in the notion of <EM>merge</EM>.  It
    will not do to merge the two streams by simply taking alternately one
    request from Peter and one request from Paul. Suppose Paul accesses
    the account only very rarely.  We could hardly force Peter to wait for
    Paul to access the account before he could issue a second transaction.
    <INDEX>infinite stream(s)<SUBINDEX>merging</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
    However such a merge is implemented, it must interleave the two
    transaction streams in some way that is constrained by <QUOTE>real
    time</QUOTE> as perceived by Peter and Paul, in the sense that, if Peter and
    Paul meet, they can agree that certain transactions were processed
    before the meeting, and other transactions were processed after the
    meeting.<FOOTNOTE>Observe that, for any two streams, there is in general
    more than one
    acceptable order of interleaving.  Thus, technically, <QUOTE>merge</QUOTE>
    is a
    <INDEX>nondeterminism, in behavior of concurrent programs</INDEX>
    <INDEX>infinite stream(s)<SUBINDEX>merging as a relation</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
    relation rather than a function<EMDASH/>the answer is not a
    deterministic function of the inputs.  We already mentioned
    (footnote<SPACE/><REF NAME="foot:nondeterministic"/>) that nondeterminism
    is essential when dealing with concurrency.  The merge relation illustrates
    the same essential nondeterminism, from the functional perspective.
    In section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:nondeterministic-evaluation"/>, we
    will look at nondeterminism from yet another point of view.</FOOTNOTE>
    This is precisely the same constraint that we had to deal with in
    section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:nature-of-time"/>, where we found the need to
    introduce explicit synchronization to ensure a <QUOTE>correct</QUOTE> order
    of events in concurrent processing of objects with state.  Thus, in an
    attempt to support the functional style, the need to merge inputs from
    different agents reintroduces the same problems that the functional style
    was meant to eliminate.

    We began this chapter with the goal of building computational models
    whose structure matches our perception of the real world we are trying
    to model.  We can model the world as a collection of separate,
    time-bound, interacting objects with state, or we can model the world
    as a single, timeless, stateless unity.  Each view has powerful
    advantages, but neither view alone is completely satisfactory.  A
    grand unification has yet to emerge.<FOOTNOTE>The object model approximates
    the world by dividing it into separate pieces.  The functional model does
    not

    modularize along object boundaries.  The object model is useful when
    the unshared state of the <QUOTE>objects</QUOTE> is much larger than the
    state that they share.  An example of a place where the object viewpoint
    fails is 
    <INDEX>quantum mechanics</INDEX>
    quantum mechanics, where thinking of things as individual particles leads
    to paradoxes and confusions.  Unifying the object view with the
    functional view may have little to do with programming, but rather
    with fundamental epistemological issues.</FOOTNOTE>
