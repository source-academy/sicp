    We have introduced data abstraction, a methodology for structuring
    systems in such a way that much of a program can be specified
    independent of the choices involved in implementing the data objects
    that the program manipulates.  For example, we saw in
    section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:rationals"/> how to separate the task of designing a
    program that uses rational numbers from the task of implementing
    rational numbers in terms of the computer language<APOS/>s primitive
    mechanisms for constructing compound data.  The key idea was to erect
    an abstraction barrier<EMDASH/>in this case, the selectors and constructors
    for rational numbers (<SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>make-rat</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>make_rat</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>, <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>numer</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>numer</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>, <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>denom</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>denom</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>)<EMDASH/>that
    isolates the way rational numbers are used from their underlying
    representation in terms of list structure.  A similar abstraction
    barrier isolates the details of the
    <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
    that perform rational
    arithmetic (<SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>add-rat</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>add_rat</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>, <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>sub-rat</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>sub_rat</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>, <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>mul-rat</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>mul_rat</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>, and <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>div-rat</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>div_rat</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>) from the <QUOTE>higher-level</QUOTE>
    <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
    that use rational
    numbers.  The resulting program has the structure shown in
    figure<SPACE/><REF NAME="fig:abstraction-barriers"/>.

    These data-abstraction barriers are powerful tools for controlling
    complexity.  By isolating the underlying representations of data
    objects, we can divide the task of designing a large program into
    smaller tasks that can be performed separately.  But this kind of data
    abstraction is not yet powerful enough, because it may not always make
    sense to speak of <QUOTE>the underlying representation</QUOTE> for a data object.
    </TEXT>
    <TEXT>
    For one thing, there might be more than one useful representation for
    a data object, and we might like to design systems that can deal with
    multiple representations.  To take a simple example, complex numbers
    may be represented in two almost equivalent ways: in rectangular form
    (real and imaginary parts) and in polar form (magnitude and angle).
    Sometimes rectangular form is more appropriate and sometimes polar
    form is more appropriate.  Indeed, it is perfectly plausible to
    imagine a system in which complex numbers are represented in both
    ways, and in which the
    <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
    for manipulating complex numbers work
    with either representation.

    <TEXT>
    More importantly, programming systems are often designed by many
    people working over extended periods of time, subject to requirements
    that change over time.  In such an environment, it is simply not
    possible for everyone to agree in advance on choices of data
    representation.  So in addition to the data-abstraction barriers that
    isolate representation from use, we need abstraction barriers that
    isolate different design choices from each other and permit different
    choices to coexist in a single program.  Furthermore, since large
    programs are often created by combining pre-existing modules that were
    designed in isolation, we need conventions that permit programmers to
    incorporate modules into larger systems 
    <INDEX>additivity</INDEX>
    <EM>additively</EM>, that is,
    without having to redesign or reimplement these modules.

    In this section, we will learn how to cope with data that may be
    represented in different ways by different parts of a program.  This
    requires constructing 
    <INDEX>generic

    <INDEX><SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE><SUBINDEX>generic</SUBINDEX></INDEX>

      <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE></EM><EMDASH/><SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
    that can
    operate on data that may be represented in more than one way.  Our
    main technique for building generic
    <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
    will be to work in terms
    of data objects that have 
    <INDEX>type tag</INDEX>
    <EM>type tags</EM>, that is, data objects
    that include explicit information about how they are to be processed.
    We will also discuss 
    <INDEX>data-directed programming</INDEX>
    <EM>data-directed</EM> programming, a powerful and
    convenient implementation strategy for additively assembling systems
    with generic operations.
    </TEXT>
    <TEXT>
    We begin with the simple complex-number example. We will see how
    type tags and data-directed style enable us to design separate
    rectangular and polar representations for complex numbers while
    maintaining the notion of an abstract <QUOTE>complex-number</QUOTE> data object.
    <INDEX>complex-number arithmetic</INDEX>
    <INDEX>arithmetic<SUBINDEX>on complex numbers</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
    We will accomplish this by defining arithmetic
    <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
    for complex
    numbers (<SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>add-complex</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>add_complex</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>, <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>sub-complex</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>sub_complex</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>, <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>mul-complex</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>mul_complex</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>, and
    <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>div-complex</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>div_complex</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>) in terms of generic selectors that access parts of
    a complex number independent of how the number is represented.  The
    resulting complex-number system, as shown in
    figure<SPACE/><REF NAME="fig:complex-system"/>, contains two different kinds of
    <INDEX>abstraction barriers<SUBINDEX>in complex-number system</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
    abstraction barriers.  The <QUOTE>horizontal</QUOTE> abstraction barriers play
    the same role as the ones in
    figure<SPACE/><REF NAME="fig:abstraction-barriers"/>.  They isolate <QUOTE>higher-level</QUOTE>
    operations from <QUOTE>lower-level</QUOTE> representations.  In addition, there
    is a <QUOTE>vertical</QUOTE> barrier that gives us the ability to separately
    design and install alternative representations.

    In section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:generic-operators"/> we will show how to use
    type tags and data-directed style to develop a generic arithmetic
    package.  This provides

    that can be used to manipulate all sorts of <QUOTE>numbers</QUOTE> and can be
    easily extended when a new kind of number is needed.
    In section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:symbolic-algebra"/>, we<APOS/>ll show how to use generic
    arithmetic in a system that performs symbolic algebra.
