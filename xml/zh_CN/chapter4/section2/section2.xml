    Now that we have an evaluator expressed as a

    simply by modifying the evaluator.  Indeed, new languages are often
    invented by first writing an evaluator that embeds the new language
    within an existing high-level language.  For example, if we wish to
    discuss some aspect of a proposed modification to
    <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME>Lisp</SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT>JavaScript</JAVASCRIPT>
    <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></SPLITINLINE>
    with another member of the

    community, we can supply an evaluator that embodies
    the change.  The recipient can then experiment with the new
    evaluator and send back comments as further modifications.  Not only
    does the high-level implementation base make it easier to test and
    debug the evaluator; in addition, the embedding enables the designer
    to snarf<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><FOOTNOTE>Snarf: <QUOTE>To grab, especially a large document or

    Only later (if ever) need the designer go to the trouble of building a
    complete implementation in a low-level language or in hardware.  In
