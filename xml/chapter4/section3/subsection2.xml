  The following puzzle (taken from <CITATION>Dinesman 1968</CITATION>) 
  is typical of a large class of simple logic puzzles:

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    Baker, Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith live on different floors of
    an apartment house that contains only five floors.  Baker does not
    live on the top floor.  Cooper does not live on the bottom floor.
    Fletcher does not live on either the top or the bottom floor.  Miller
    lives on a higher floor than does Cooper.  Smith does not live on a
    floor adjacent to Fletcher<APOS/>s.  Fletcher does not live on a floor
    adjacent to Cooper<APOS/>s.  Where does everyone live?

  We can determine who lives on each floor in a straightforward way by

  In the multiple dwelling problem, how many sets of assignments are
  there of people to floors, both before and after the requirement that
  floor assignments be distinct?  It is very inefficient to generate all
  possible assignments of people to floors and then leave it to
  backtracking to eliminate them.  For example, most of the restrictions
  depend on only one or two of the person-floor variables, and can thus
  be imposed before floors have been selected for all the people.

  Programs designed to accept natural language as input usually start by
  attempting to <EM>parse</EM> the input, that is, to match the input
  against some grammatical structure.  For example, we might try to
  recognize simple sentences consisting of an article followed by a noun
  followed by a verb, such as <QUOTE>The cat eats.</QUOTE>  To accomplish such an
  analysis, we must be able to identify the parts of speech of
  individual words.  We could start with some lists that classify
  various words:<FOOTNOTE>Here we use the convention that the first element of each list
    designates the part of speech for the rest of the words in the list.</FOOTNOTE>

  We also need a <EM>grammar</EM>, that is, a set of rules describing how
  grammatical elements are composed from simpler elements.  A very
  simple grammar might stipulate that a sentence always consists of two
  pieces<EMDASH/>a noun phrase followed by a verb<EMDASH/>and that a noun phrase
  consists of an article followed by a noun.  With this grammar, the
  sentence <QUOTE>The cat eats</QUOTE> is parsed as follows:

  With the grammar given above, the following sentence can be parsed in
  five different ways:
  <QUOTE>The professor lectures to the student in the class with the cat.</QUOTE>
  Give the five parses and explain the differences in shades of
  meaning among them.

  <INDEX>nondeterministic evaluator<SUBINDEX>order of operand evaluation</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
  The evaluators in sections<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:mc-eval"/> and <REF NAME="sec:lazy-evaluation"/>
  do not determine what order operands are evaluated in.
  We will see that the <SCHEMEINLINE>amb</SCHEMEINLINE> evaluator evaluates them from left to right.
  Explain why our parsing program wouldn<APOS/>t work if the operands were evaluated
  in some other order.

  Louis Reasoner suggests that, since a verb phrase is either a verb or
  a verb phrase followed by a prepositional phrase, it would be much more
  straightforward to define the
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
  <SCHEMEINLINE>parse-verb-phrase</SCHEMEINLINE> as
  follows (and similarly for noun phrases):
  <SNIPPET EVAL="no">
    <SCHEME>
      (define (parse-verb-phrase)
      (amb (parse-word verbs)
      (list 'verb-phrase
            (parse-verb-phrase)
            (parse-prepositional-phrase))))
    </SCHEME>
    <JAVASCRIPT>
function parse_verb_phrase() {
    return amb(parse_word(verbs),      
               list("verb-phrase",
                    parse_verb_phrase(),
                    parse_prepositional_phrase()));
}
    </JAVASCRIPT>
  </SNIPPET>
  Does this work?  Does the program<APOS/>s behavior change if we interchange
  the order of expressions in the <SCHEMEINLINE>amb</SCHEMEINLINE>?

  Extend the grammar given above to handle more complex sentences.  For
  example, you could extend noun phrases and verb phrases to include
  adjectives and adverbs, or you could handle compound sentences.<FOOTNOTE>This kind of grammar can become arbitrarily complex, but it
    <INDEX>parsing natural language<SUBINDEX>real language understanding vs. toy parser</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
    is only a toy as far as real language understanding is concerned.
    Real natural-language understanding by computer requires an elaborate
    mixture of syntactic analysis and interpretation of meaning.  On the
    other hand, even toy parsers can be useful in supporting flexible
    command languages for programs such as information-retrieval systems.

  <INDEX>generating sentences</INDEX>
  Alyssa P. Hacker is more interested in generating interesting
  sentences than in parsing them.  She reasons that by simply changing
  the
  <SPLITINLINE>
    <SCHEME>procedure
    <SCHEMEINLINE>parse\?word</SCHEMEINLINE>
    </SCHEME>
    <JAVASCRIPT>function
    <JAVASCRIPTINLINE>parse_word</JAVASCRIPTINLINE>
    </JAVASCRIPT>
  </SPLITINLINE>
    so that it ignores the <QUOTE>input
    sentence</QUOTE> and instead always succeeds and generates an appropriate
  word, we can use the programs we had built for parsing to do
  generation instead.  Implement Alyssa<APOS/>s idea, and show the first
  half-dozen or so sentences generated.<FOOTNOTE>Although Alyssa<APOS/>s idea works just fine (and is
    surprisingly simple), the sentences that it generates are a bit
    boring<EMDASH/>they don<APOS/>t sample the possible sentences of this language in
    a very interesting way.  In fact, the grammar is highly recursive in
    many places, and Alyssa<APOS/>s technique <QUOTE>falls into</QUOTE> one of these recursions and
    gets stuck.  See exercise<SPACE/><REF NAME="ex:ramb"/> for a way to deal with this.</FOOTNOTE>
