              Of course, the Lisp interpreter needs to evaluate
              <SCHEMEINLINE>(define size 2)</SCHEMEINLINE>
              before the name <SCHEMEINLINE>size</SCHEMEINLINE> can be used
              in an expression. In this online book, the program parts that need to be
              evaluated before a new part are omitted for brevity.
              However, in order to see and play with the entire
              program, you can click on the button <BUTTON TEXT="Play"/>,
              which appears after
              evaluating a program. The entire program then
              appears in editable form in a separate window.
              Thus, as a result of clicking <BUTTON TEXT="Play"/> after evaluating
              <SNIPPET>
                <REQUIRES>var_size</REQUIRES>

              Note that Scheme programs can be placed in a sequence.
              The interpreter evaluates the components of the sequence in the given order,
              and returns the value of the last component as the value of the sequence.

              Of course, the JavaScript interpreter needs to execute the constant
              declaration for <JAVASCRIPTINLINE>size</JAVASCRIPTINLINE>
              before the name <JAVASCRIPTINLINE>size</JAVASCRIPTINLINE> can be used

              The program, preceeded by all required statements, then
              appears in a new browser tab.

              You notice here that JavaScript statements can be placed in a sequence.
              The interpreter evaluates the components of the sequence in the given order,

              It should be clear that the possibility of associating values with
              names and later retrieving them means that the interpreter must
              maintain some sort of memory that keeps track of the name-object
              pairs.  This memory is called the
