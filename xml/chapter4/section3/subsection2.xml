    Section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:amb-implementation"/> describes the
    implementation of the <SCHEMEINLINE>amb</SCHEMEINLINE> evaluator.  First,
    however, we give some examples of how it can be used.  The advantage of
    nondeterministic programming is that we can suppress the details of how
    search is carried out, thereby
    expressing our programs at a higher level of

    The following puzzle (taken from
    <INDEX>Dinesman, Howard P.</INDEX>
    <CITATION>Dinesman 1968</CITATION>) 
    is typical of a large class of simple logic puzzles:
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      Baker, Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith live on different floors of
      an apartment house that contains only five floors.  Baker does not
      live on the top floor.  Cooper does not live on the bottom floor.
      Fletcher does not live on either the top or the bottom floor.  Miller
      lives on a higher floor than does Cooper.  Smith does not live on a
      floor adjacent to Fletcher<APOS/>s.  Fletcher does not live on a floor
      adjacent to Cooper<APOS/>s.  Where does everyone live?

    In the multiple dwelling problem, how many sets of assignments are
    there of people to floors, both before and after the requirement that
    floor assignments be distinct?  It is very inefficient to generate all
    possible assignments of people to floors and then leave it to
    backtracking to eliminate them.  For example, most of the restrictions

    Programs designed to accept natural language as input usually start by
    attempting to <EM>parse</EM> the input, that is, to match the input
    against some grammatical structure.  For example, we might try to
    recognize simple sentences consisting of an article followed by a noun
    followed by a verb, such as <QUOTE>The cat eats.</QUOTE>  To accomplish
    such an analysis, we must be able to identify the parts of speech of
    individual words.  We could start with some lists that classify various
    words:<FOOTNOTE>Here we use the convention that the first element of each
    list designates the part of speech for the rest of the words in the
    list.</FOOTNOTE>

    We also need a

    <EM>grammar</EM>, that is, a set of rules describing how
    grammatical elements are composed from simpler elements.  A very
    simple grammar might stipulate that a sentence always consists of two
    pieces<EMDASH/>a noun phrase followed by a verb<EMDASH/>and that a noun
    phrase consists of an article followed by a noun.  With this grammar, the
