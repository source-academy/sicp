  <INDEX>compiler for Scheme<SUBINDEX>analyzing evaluator vs.</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
  In section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:separating-analysis"/> we modified our original
  metacircular interpreter to separate analysis from execution.  We
  analyzed each expression to produce an execution
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
  that took
  an environment as argument and performed the required operations.  In
  our compiler, we will do essentially the same analysis.  Instead of
  producing execution
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>, however, we will generate sequences of
  instructions to be run by our register machine.

      <TEXT>
  The
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
  <SCHEMEINLINE>compile</SCHEMEINLINE> is the top-level dispatch in the compiler.
  It corresponds to the <SCHEMEINLINE>eval</SCHEMEINLINE>
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
  of
  section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:core-of-evaluator"/>, the <SCHEMEINLINE>analyze</SCHEMEINLINE>
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
  of
  section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:separating-analysis"/>, and the <SCHEMEINLINE>eval-dispatch</SCHEMEINLINE>
  entry point of the explicit-control-evaluator in
  section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:eceval-core"/>.
  The compiler, like the interpreters, uses the 
  <INDEX>compiler for Scheme<SUBINDEX>expression-syntax

  expression-syntax
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
  defined in section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:representing-expressions"/>.<FOOTNOTE>Notice, however, that our
    compiler is a Scheme program, and the syntax
    <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
    that it uses
    to manipulate expressions are the actual Scheme
    <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
    used with
    the metacircular evaluator.  For the explicit-control evaluator, in
    contrast, we assumed that equivalent syntax operations were available
    as operations for the register machine.  (Of course, when we simulated
    the register machine in Scheme, we used the actual Scheme
    <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
    in our register machine simulation.)</FOOTNOTE>
  <SCHEMEINLINE>Compile</SCHEMEINLINE> performs a case

  <SCHEMEINLINE>Compile</SCHEMEINLINE> and the code generators that it calls take two arguments
  in addition to the expression to compile.  There is a 
  <INDEX>target register</INDEX>
  <EM>target</EM>,
  which specifies the register in which the compiled code is to return
  the value of the expression.  There is also a 
  <INDEX>linkage descriptor</INDEX>
  <EM>linkage
    descriptor</EM>, which describes how the code resulting from the
  compilation of the expression should proceed when it has finished its
  execution.  The linkage descriptor can require that the code do one of
  the following three things:

  <UL>
    <LI>continue at the next instruction in sequence (this is

  Compiling the same expression with a linkage of <SCHEMEINLINE>return</SCHEMEINLINE> should

  <INDEX>compiler for Scheme<SUBINDEX>stack usage</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
  Whenever registers might need to be saved, the compiler<APOS/>s code generators use
  <!--  \indcode{preserving} -->
  <SCHEMEINLINE>preserving</SCHEMEINLINE>, which is a more subtle method for combining
  instruction sequences.  <SCHEMEINLINE>Preserving</SCHEMEINLINE> takes three arguments: a set
  of registers and two instruction sequences that are to be executed
  sequentially.  It appends the sequences in such a way that the
  contents of each register in the set is preserved over the execution
  of the first sequence, if this is needed for the execution of the
  second sequence.  That is, if the first sequence modifies the register
  and the second sequence actually needs the register<APOS/>s original
  contents, then <SCHEMEINLINE>preserving</SCHEMEINLINE> wraps a <SCHEMEINLINE>save</SCHEMEINLINE> and a <SCHEMEINLINE>restore</SCHEMEINLINE>
  of the register around the first sequence before appending the
  sequences.  Otherwise, <SCHEMEINLINE>preserving</SCHEMEINLINE> simply returns the appended
  instruction sequences.  Thus, for example,
  <SNIPPET EVAL="no">
    <SCHEME>
      (preserving (list ^$reg_1$^ ^$reg_2$^) ^$seq_1$^ ^$seq_2$^)
    </SCHEME>
  </SNIPPET>
  produces one of the following four sequences of instructions, depending on how
  <LATEXINLINE>$seq_1$</LATEXINLINE> and <LATEXINLINE>$seq_2$</LATEXINLINE> use <LATEXINLINE>$reg_1$</LATEXINLINE> and <LATEXINLINE>$reg_2$</LATEXINLINE>:

  By using <SCHEMEINLINE>preserving</SCHEMEINLINE> to combine instruction sequences the
  compiler avoids unnecessary stack operations.  This also isolates the
  details of whether or not to generate <SCHEMEINLINE>save</SCHEMEINLINE> and <SCHEMEINLINE>restore</SCHEMEINLINE>
  instructions within the <SCHEMEINLINE>preserving</SCHEMEINLINE>
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>, separating them
  from the concerns that arise in writing each of the individual code
  generators.
  In fact no <SCHEMEINLINE>save</SCHEMEINLINE> or <SCHEMEINLINE>restore</SCHEMEINLINE> instructions are explicitly
  produced by the code generators.

  In principle, we could represent an instruction sequence simply as a
  list of instructions.  <SCHEMEINLINE>Append-instruction-sequences</SCHEMEINLINE> could then
  combine instruction sequences by performing an ordinary list <SCHEMEINLINE>append</SCHEMEINLINE>.  However, <SCHEMEINLINE>preserving</SCHEMEINLINE> would then be a complex operation,
  because it would have to analyze each instruction sequence to
  determine how the sequence uses its registers.  <SCHEMEINLINE>Preserving</SCHEMEINLINE>
  would be inefficient as well as complex, because it would have to
  analyze each of its instruction sequence arguments, even though these
  sequences might themselves have been constructed by calls to <SCHEMEINLINE>preserving</SCHEMEINLINE>, in which case their parts would have already been
  analyzed.  To avoid such repetitious analysis we will associate with each
  instruction sequence some information about its register use.
  When we construct a basic instruction sequence we
  will provide this information explicitly,
  and the
  <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
  that combine instruction sequences will derive
  register-use information for the combined sequence from the
  information associated with the component sequences.

  An instruction sequence will contain three pieces of information:
  <UL>
    <LI>the set of registers that must be initialized before the
      instructions in the sequence are executed (these registers are said to
      be <EM>needed</EM> by the sequence),
    </LI>
    <LI>the set of registers whose values are modified by the
      instructions in the sequence, and

    <LI>the actual instructions (also called <EM>statements</EM>) in
      the sequence.

  We will represent an instruction sequence as a list of its three
  parts.  The constructor for instruction sequences is thus

      (define (make-instruction-sequence needs modifies statements)

  For example, the two-instruction sequence that looks up the value of
  the variable <SCHEMEINLINE>x</SCHEMEINLINE> in the current environment, assigns the result
  to <SCHEMEINLINE>val</SCHEMEINLINE>, and then returns, requires registers <SCHEMEINLINE>env</SCHEMEINLINE> and <SCHEMEINLINE>continue</SCHEMEINLINE> to have been initialized, and modifies register <SCHEMEINLINE>val</SCHEMEINLINE>.
  This sequence would therefore be constructed as

  <SNIPPET>
    <SCHEME>
      (make-instruction-sequence '(env continue) '(val)
      '((assign val
            (op lookup-variable-value) (const x) (reg env))

  build such optimizations into the evaluator.  Indeed, the

  performs a similar optimization, by treating combinations with no

      Extend the explicit-control evaluator to recognize as a separate class

      Alyssa P. Hacker suggests that by extending the evaluator to recognize
      more and more special cases we could incorporate all the compiler<APOS/>s
