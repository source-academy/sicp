      In section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:black-box"/>, we noted
      that a
      <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
      used as an element in creating a more complex
      <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
      could be regarded not only as a collection of particular
      operations but also as a 
      <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedural</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functional</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
      abstraction.  That is, the details
      of how the
      <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
      was implemented could be suppressed, and the
      particular
      <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
      itself could be replaced by any other
      <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
      with the same overall behavior.  In other words, we could make an
      abstraction that would separate the way the
      <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
      would be used
      from the details of how the
      <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
      would be implemented in terms of
      more primitive
      <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>.  The analogous notion for compound data is
      called 
      <INDEX>data abstraction</INDEX>
      <EM>data abstraction</EM>.  Data abstraction is a methodology that
      enables us to isolate how a compound data object is used from the
      details of how it is constructed from more primitive data objects.

    <TEXT>
      The basic idea of data abstraction is to structure the programs that
      are to use compound data objects so that they operate on 
      <INDEX>abstract data</INDEX>
      <INDEX>data<SUBINDEX>abstract</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
      <QUOTE>abstract
        data.</QUOTE> That is, our programs should use data in such a way as to make
      no assumptions about the data that are not strictly necessary for
      performing the task at hand.  At the same time, a 
      <INDEX>concrete data representation</INDEX>
      <INDEX>data<SUBINDEX>concrete representation of</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
      <QUOTE>concrete</QUOTE> data
      representation is defined independent of the programs that use
      the data.  The interface between these two parts of our system will be
      a set of
      <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>, called 
      <INDEX>selector</INDEX>
      <EM>selectors</EM> and 
      <INDEX>constructor</INDEX>
      <EM>constructors</EM>,
      that implement the abstract data in terms of the concrete
      representation.  To illustrate this technique, we will consider how to
      design a set of
      <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
      for manipulating rational numbers.
