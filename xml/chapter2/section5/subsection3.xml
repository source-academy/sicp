      The manipulation of symbolic algebraic expressions is a complex
      process that illustrates many of the hardest problems that occur in
      the design of large-scale systems.  An algebraic expression, in
      <INDEX>algebraic expression</INDEX>
      general, can be viewed as a hierarchical structure, a tree of
      operators applied to operands.  We can construct algebraic expressions
      by starting with a set of primitive objects, such as constants and
      variables, and combining these by means of algebraic operators, such
      as addition and multiplication.  As in other languages, we form
      abstractions that enable us to refer to compound objects in simple
      terms.  Typical abstractions in symbolic algebra are ideas such as
      linear combination, polynomial, rational function, or trigonometric
      function.  We can regard these as compound <QUOTE>types,</QUOTE> which are often
      useful for directing the processing of expressions.  For example, we
      could describe the expression

      <LATEX>
        \[ x^{2}\, \sin (y^2+1)+x\, \cos 2y+\cos (y^3 -2y^2) \]
      </LATEX>
      as a polynomial in <LATEXINLINE>$x$</LATEXINLINE> with coefficients that are trigonometric
      functions of polynomials in <LATEXINLINE>$y$</LATEXINLINE> whose coefficients are integers.

      We will not attempt to develop a complete algebraic-manipulation
      system here.  Such systems are exceedingly complex programs, embodying
      deep algebraic knowledge and elegant algorithms.  What we will do is
      look at a simple but important part of algebraic manipulation: the
      arithmetic of polynomials.  We will illustrate the kinds of decisions
      the designer of such a system faces, and how to apply the ideas of
      abstract data and generic operations to help organize this effort.

      <TEXT>
      Our first task in designing a system for performing arithmetic on
      polynomials is to decide just what a polynomial is.  Polynomials are
      normally defined relative to certain variables (the 
      <INDEX>indeterminate of a polynomial</INDEX>
      <INDEX>polynomial(s)<SUBINDEX>indeterminate of</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
      <EM>
        indeterminates</EM> of the polynomial).  For simplicity, we will restrict
      ourselves to polynomials having just one indeterminate (
      <INDEX>univariate polynomial</INDEX>
      <INDEX>polynomial(s)<SUBINDEX>univariate</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
      <EM>
        univariate polynomials</EM>).<FOOTNOTE>On the other hand, we will allow
        polynomials whose coefficients are themselves polynomials in other
        variables.  This will give us essentially the same representational
        power as a full multivariate system, although it does lead to coercion
        problems, as discussed below.</FOOTNOTE> We will define a polynomial to be a
      sum of terms, each of which is either a coefficient, a power of the
      indeterminate, or a product of a coefficient and a power of the
      indeterminate.  A coefficient is defined as an algebraic expression
      that is not dependent upon the indeterminate of the polynomial.  For
      example,
      <LATEX>
        \[ 5x^2 +3x +7 \]
      </LATEX>
      is a simple polynomial in <LATEXINLINE>$x$</LATEXINLINE>, and
      <LATEX>
        \[ (y^2 +1)x^3 +(2y)x+1 \]
      </LATEX>
      is a polynomial in <LATEXINLINE>$x$</LATEXINLINE> whose coefficients are polynomials in <LATEXINLINE>$y$</LATEXINLINE>.
      </TEXT>
      <TEXT>
      Already we are skirting some thorny issues.  Is the first of these
      polynomials the same as the polynomial <LATEXINLINE>$5y^2 +3y +7$</LATEXINLINE>, or not?  A
      reasonable answer might be <QUOTE>yes, if we are considering a polynomial
        purely as a mathematical function, but no, if we are considering a
        polynomial to be a syntactic form.</QUOTE>  The second polynomial is
      algebraically equivalent to a polynomial in <LATEXINLINE>$y$</LATEXINLINE> whose coefficients are
      polynomials in <LATEXINLINE>$x$</LATEXINLINE>.  Should our system recognize this, or not?
      Furthermore, there are other ways to represent a polynomial<EMDASH/>for
      example, as a product of factors, or (for a univariate polynomial) as
      the set of roots, or as a listing of the values of the polynomial at a
      specified set of points.<FOOTNOTE>For univariate polynomials, giving
        the value of a polynomial at a given set of points can be a
        particularly good representation.  This makes polynomial arithmetic
        extremely simple.  To obtain, for example, the sum of two polynomials
        represented in this way, we need only add the values of the
        polynomials at corresponding points.  To transform back to a more
        familiar representation, we can use the 
        <INDEX>Lagrange interpolation formula</INDEX>
        Lagrange interpolation
        formula, which shows how to recover the coefficients of a polynomial
        of degree <LATEXINLINE>$n$</LATEXINLINE> given the values of the polynomial at <LATEXINLINE>$n+1$</LATEXINLINE> points.</FOOTNOTE>
      We can finesse these questions by deciding that in our
      algebraic-manipulation system a <QUOTE>polynomial</QUOTE> will be a
      particular syntactic form, not its underlying mathematical meaning.
      </TEXT>
      <TEXT>
      Now we must consider how to go about doing arithmetic on polynomials.
      In this simple system, we will consider only addition and
      multiplication.  Moreover, we will insist that two polynomials to be
      combined must have the same indeterminate.
      </TEXT>
      <TEXT>
      We will approach the design of our system by following the familiar
      discipline of data abstraction.  We will represent polynomials using a
      data structure called a 
      <INDEX>poly</INDEX>
      <EM>poly</EM>, which consists of a variable and a
      <INDEX>term list of polynomial</INDEX>
      collection of terms.  We assume that we have selectors <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>variable</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>variable</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
      and <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>term-list</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>term_list</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> that extract those parts from a poly and

      Polynomial addition is performed termwise.  Terms of the same order
      (i.e., with the same power of the indeterminate) must be combined.
      This is done by forming a new term of the same order whose coefficient
      is the sum of the coefficients of the addends.  Terms in one addend
      for which there are no terms of the same order in the other addend are
      simply accumulated into the sum polynomial being constructed.

      Finally, we must confront the job of implementing a good

      coefficients keyed by the order of the term.  Hence, any of the

      </TEXT>
      <TEXT>
      How should we structure the list that represents a term list?  One
      consideration is the <QUOTE>density</QUOTE> of the polynomials we intend to

      <INDEX>dense polynomial</INDEX>
      <INDEX>polynomial(s)<SUBINDEX>dense</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
      <EM>dense</EM> if it has nonzero

      <LATEX>
        \[ A:\quad x^5 +2x^4 +3x^2 -2x -5 \]
      </LATEX>
      is a dense polynomial, whereas
      <LATEX>
        \[ B:\quad x^{100} +2x^2 +1 \]
      </LATEX>
      is sparse.
      </TEXT>
      <TEXT>
      The term lists of dense polynomials are most efficiently represented
      as lists of the coefficients.  For example, <LATEXINLINE>$A$</LATEXINLINE> above would be nicely
      represented as <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>(1 2 0 3 -2 -5)</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>list(1, 2, 0, 3, -2, -5)</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>.  The order of a term in this
      representation is the length of the sublist beginning with that term<APOS/>s
      coefficient, decremented by 1.<FOOTNOTE>In these polynomial examples,
        we assume that we have implemented the generic arithmetic system using
        the type mechanism suggested in exercise<SPACE/><REF NAME="ex:internal-type-system"/>.
        Thus, coefficients that are ordinary numbers will be represented as
        the numbers themselves rather than as pairs whose <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>car</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>head</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> is the
        symbol <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>scheme-number</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>javascript_number</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT>
      </SPLITINLINE>.</FOOTNOTE>  
      This would be a terrible representation for a
      sparse polynomial such as <LATEXINLINE>$B$</LATEXINLINE>: There would be a giant list of zeros
      punctuated by a few lonely nonzero terms.  A more reasonable
      representation of the term list of a sparse polynomial is as a list of
      the nonzero terms, where each term is a list containing the order of the
      term and the coefficient for that order.  In such a scheme, polynomial
      <LATEXINLINE>$B$</LATEXINLINE> is efficiently represented as <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>((100 1) (2 2) (0 1))</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>list(list(100, 1), list(2, 2), list(0, 1))</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>.  As
      most polynomial manipulations are performed on sparse polynomials, we
      will use this method.  We will assume that term lists are represented
      as lists of terms, arranged from highest-order to lowest-order term.
      Once we have made this decision, implementing the selectors and
      constructors for terms and term lists is straightforward:<FOOTNOTE>Although

        Suppose we want to have a polynomial system that is efficient for both
        sparse and dense polynomials.  One way to do this is to allow both
        kinds of term-list representations in our system.  The situation is
        analogous to the complex-number example of section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:multiple-reps"/>,
        where we allowed both rectangular and polar representations.
        To do this we must distinguish different types of term lists and make
        the operations on term lists generic.  Redesign the polynomial system
        to implement this generalization.  This is a major effort, not a local
        change.

        <INDEX>polynomial arithmetic<SUBINDEX>division</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
        A univariate polynomial can be divided by another one to produce a
        polynomial quotient and a polynomial remainder.  For example,

        <LATEX>
          \[ \frac{x^5-1}{x^2 -1}=x^3 +x,\text{ remainder }x-1 \]
        </LATEX>


        Division can be performed via long division.
        That is, divide the highest-order term of the dividend by
        the highest-order term of the divisor.  The result is the first term of the
        quotient.  Next, multiply the result by the divisor, subtract that
        from the dividend, and produce the rest of the answer by recursively
        dividing the difference by the divisor.  Stop when the order of the
        divisor exceeds the order of the dividend and declare the dividend to
        be the remainder.  Also, if the dividend ever becomes zero, return
        zero as both quotient and remainder.

      Our polynomial system illustrates how objects of one type
      (polynomials) may in fact be complex objects that have objects of many
      different types as parts.  This poses no real difficulty in defining
      generic operations.  We need only install appropriate generic operations
      for performing the necessary manipulations of the parts of the
      compound types.  In fact, we saw that polynomials form a kind of
      <QUOTE>recursive data abstraction,</QUOTE> in that parts of a polynomial may
      themselves be polynomials.  Our generic operations and our
      data-directed programming style can handle this complication without
      much trouble.
      </TEXT>
      <TEXT>
      On the other hand, polynomial algebra is a system for which the data
      types cannot be naturally arranged in a tower.  For instance, it is
      possible to have polynomials in <LATEXINLINE>$x$</LATEXINLINE> whose coefficients are polynomials
      in <LATEXINLINE>$y$</LATEXINLINE>.  It is also possible to have polynomials in <LATEXINLINE>$y$</LATEXINLINE> whose
      coefficients are polynomials in <LATEXINLINE>$x$</LATEXINLINE>.  Neither of these types is
      <QUOTE>above</QUOTE> the other in any natural way, yet it is often necessary to
      add together elements from each set.  There are several ways to do
      this.  One possibility is to convert one polynomial to the type of the
      other by expanding and rearranging terms so that both polynomials have
      the same principal variable.  One can impose a towerlike structure on
      this by ordering the variables and thus always converting any
      polynomial to a 
      <INDEX>canonical form, for polynomials</INDEX>
      <INDEX>polynomial(s)<SUBINDEX>canonical form</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
      <QUOTE>canonical form</QUOTE> with the highest-priority variable

      This strategy works fairly well, except that the conversion may expand
      a polynomial unnecessarily, making it hard to read and perhaps less
      efficient to work with.  The tower strategy is certainly not natural
      for this domain or for any domain where the user can invent new types
      dynamically using old types in various combining forms, such as
      trigonometric functions, power series, and integrals.

      coercion is a serious
      problem in the design of large-scale algebraic-manipulation systems.
      Much of the complexity of such systems is concerned with relationships
      among diverse types.  Indeed, it is fair to say that we do not yet
      completely understand coercion.  In fact, we do not yet completely
      understand the concept of a data type.  Nevertheless, what we know
      provides us with powerful structuring and modularity principles to
      support the design of large systems.

        Euclid<APOS/>s Algorithm works for polynomials is formalized in algebra

      We can solve the problem exhibited in exercise<SPACE/><REF NAME="ex:gcd-of-polys"/> if
      we use the following modification of the GCD algorithm (which really
      works only in the case of polynomials with integer coefficients).
      Before performing any polynomial division in the GCD computation, we
      multiply the dividend by an integer constant factor, chosen to
      guarantee that no fractions will arise during the division process.
      Our answer will thus differ from the actual GCD by an integer constant
      factor, but this does not matter in the case of reducing rational
      functions to lowest terms; the GCD will be used to divide both the
      numerator and denominator, so the integer constant factor will cancel
      out.

            To test your program, try the example at the beginning of this
            extended exercise:

                (define p3 (make-polynomial 'x '((1 1))))
                (define p4 (make-polynomial 'x '((2 1)(0 -1))))

                (define rf1 (make-rational p1 p2))

                                     make_term(0, 1)));
const p2 = make_polynomial("x", list(make_term(3, 1),

add(rf1, rf2);
              </JAVASCRIPT>
            </SNIPPET>

            See if you get the correct answer, correctly reduced to lowest terms.

        The GCD computation is at the heart of any system that does operations
        on rational functions.  The algorithm used above, although
        mathematically straightforward, is extremely slow.  The slowness is
        due partly to the large number of division operations and partly to
        the enormous size of the intermediate coefficients generated by the
        pseudodivisions.  One of the active areas in the development of
        algebraic-manipulation systems is the design of better algorithms for
        computing polynomial GCDs.<FOOTNOTE>One extremely efficient and

          Richard
          Zippel (1979).  The method is a probabilistic algorithm, as is the
          fast test for primality that we discussed in chapter<SPACE/>1.  Zippel<APOS/>s book
          (1993) describes this method, together with other ways to compute
          polynomial GCDs.</FOOTNOTE>
