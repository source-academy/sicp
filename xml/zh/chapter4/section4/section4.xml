    imperative
    (how to) knowledge, whereas mathematics deals with declarative (what
    is) knowledge.  Indeed, programming languages require that the
    programmer express knowledge in a form that indicates the step-by-step
    methods for solving particular problems.  On the other hand,
    high-level languages provide, as part of the language implementation,
    a substantial amount of methodological knowledge that frees
    the user from concern with numerous details of how a specified
    computation will progress.

    Most programming languages, including
    <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>Lisp,</SCHEME>
    <JAVASCRIPT>JavaScript,</JAVASCRIPT>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    are organized around
    computing the values of mathematical functions.  Expression-oriented
    languages

    </SPLITINLINE>
    capitalize on the
    <QUOTE>pun</QUOTE> that an expression that describes the value of a
    function may also be interpreted as a means of computing that value.
    Because of this, most programming languages are strongly biased toward
    unidirectional computations (computations with well-defined inputs and
    outputs). There are, however, radically different programming languages
    that relax this bias.  We saw one such example in
    section<SPACE></SPACE><REF NAME="sec:constraints"></REF>, where the objects of
    computation were arithmetic constraints.  In a constraint system the
    direction and the order of computation are not so well specified; in
    carrying out a computation the system must therefore provide more detailed
    <QUOTE>how to</QUOTE> knowledge than would be the case with an ordinary
    arithmetic computation.  This does not mean, however, that the user is
    released altogether from the responsibility of providing imperative
    knowledge. There are many constraint networks that implement the same set
    of constraints, and the user must choose from the set of mathematically
    equivalent networks a suitable network to specify a particular computation.

    The nondeterministic program evaluator of
    section<SPACE></SPACE><REF NAME="sec:nondeterministic-evaluation"></REF> also moves
    away from the view that programming is about constructing algorithms for
    computing unidirectional functions.  In a nondeterministic language,
    expressions can have more than one value, and, as a result, the
    computation is
    dealing with
    <INDEX>relations, computing in terms of</INDEX>
    relations rather than with single-valued functions.  Logic
    programming extends this idea by combining a relational vision of programming
    with a powerful kind of symbolic pattern matching called 
    <EM>unification</EM>.<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><FOOTNOTE>Logic programming has grown out of a long

    automatic theorem proving.  Early theorem-proving
    programs could accomplish very little, because they exhaustively searched
    the space of possible proofs.  The major breakthrough that made such a
    search plausible was the discovery in the early 1960s of the 
    <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><INDEX>unification<SUBINDEX>discovery of algorithm</SUBINDEX><!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></INDEX>
    <EM>unification algorithm<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></EM> and the

    <EM>resolution principle<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></EM> (<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><CITATION>Robinson 1965<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></CITATION>).  
    Resolution was used, for example, by 
    <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><INDEX>Green, Cordell<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></INDEX>
    <INDEX>Raphael, Bertram<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></INDEX>
    Green and Raphael (1968) (see also <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><CITATION>Green 1969<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></CITATION>) as the
    basis for a deductive question-answering system.  During most of this period,
    researchers concentrated on algorithms that are guaranteed to find a proof if
    one exists.  Such algorithms were difficult to control and to direct toward
    a proof.  
    <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><INDEX>Hewitt, Carl Eddie<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></INDEX>
    Hewitt (1969) recognized the possibility of merging the control structure of
    a programming language with the operations of a logic-manipulation system,
    leading to the work in automatic search mentioned in
    section<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><SPACE></SPACE><REF NAME="sec:amb"></REF>
    (footnote<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><SPACE></SPACE><REF NAME="foot:backtrack"></REF>).  At the same time that this
    was being done,
    <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><INDEX>Colmerauer, Alain<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></INDEX>
    Colmerauer, in Marseille, was developing rule-based systems for manipulating
    natural language (see <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><CITATION>Colmerauer et al.<SPACE></SPACE>1973<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></CITATION>).
    He invented a programming language called 
    <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><INDEX>Prolog<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></INDEX>
    Prolog for representing those rules.  
    <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><INDEX>Kowalski, Robert<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></INDEX>
    <CITATION>Kowalski (1973; 1979)<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></CITATION>
    in Edinburgh, recognized that execution of a Prolog program could be
    interpreted as proving theorems (using a proof technique called linear 
    <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><INDEX>resolution, Horn-clause</INDEX>
    Horn-clause resolution).  The merging of the last two strands led to the
    logic-programming movement.  Thus, in assigning credit for the development
    of logic programming, the French can point to Prolog<APOS></APOS>s genesis at the 
    <INDEX>University of Marseille</INDEX>
    University of Marseille, while the British can highlight the work at the 
    <INDEX>University of Edinburgh</INDEX>
    University of Edinburgh. According to people at 
    <INDEX>MIT</INDEX>
    MIT, logic programming was developed by these groups in an attempt to figure
    out what Hewitt was talking about in his brilliant but impenetrable Ph.D.
    thesis.  For a history of logic

    Contemporary logic programming languages (including the one we

    during the early 1980s when the Japanese government began an ambitious
    project aimed at building superfast computers optimized to run logic
    programming languages.  The speed of such computers was to be measured
    in LIPS (Logical Inferences Per Second) rather than the usual FLOPS
    (FLoating-point Operations Per Second).  Although the project
    succeeded in developing hardware and software as originally planned,
    the international computer industry moved in a different direction.

    Earlier in this chapter we explored the technology of implementing
    interpreters and described the elements that are essential to an
    interpreter for a
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME>Lisp-like</SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT>JavaScript-like</JAVASCRIPT>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    language (indeed, to an interpreter for any conventional language).  Now we
    will apply these ideas to discuss an interpreter for a logic programming
    language.  We call this
    language the
    <INDEX>query language</INDEX>
    <EM>query language</EM>, because it is very useful for
    retrieving information from data bases by formulating 
    <INDEX>query</INDEX>
    <EM>queries</EM>, or questions, expressed in the language.  Even though the
    query language is very different from
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME>Lisp,</SCHEME>
    <JAVASCRIPT>JavaScript,</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
    we will find it convenient to describe the language in terms of the same
    general framework we have been using all along: as a collection of primitive
    elements, together with means of combination that enable us to combine
    simple elements to create more complex elements and means of abstraction
    that enable us to regard complex elements as single conceptual units.  An
    interpreter for a logic programming language is considerably more complex
    than an interpreter for a language like
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME>Lisp.</SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT>JavaScript.</JAVASCRIPT>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    Nevertheless, we will see
    that our
    <INDEX>query interpreter</INDEX>
    query-language interpreter contains many of the same elements
    found in the interpreter of section<SPACE></SPACE><REF NAME="sec:mc-eval"></REF>.  In
    particular, there will be an <QUOTE>evaluate</QUOTE> part that classifies
    expressions according to type and an <QUOTE>apply</QUOTE> part that
    implements the language<APOS></APOS>s abstraction mechanism
    <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME>(procedures</SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT>(functions</JAVASCRIPT>

      <SCHEME>Lisp,</SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT>JavaScript,</JAVASCRIPT>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    and <EM>rules</EM> in the case of logic programming).  Also, a central role
    is played in the implementation by a frame data structure, which determines
    the correspondence between symbols and their associated values.  One
    additional interesting aspect of our query-language implementation is
    that we make substantial use of streams, which were introduced in
    chapter<SPACE></SPACE><REF NAME="chap:state"></REF>.
