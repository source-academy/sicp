        As we have seen, the 
<!-- <SCHEMEINLINE>set!</SCHEMEINLINE> operation -->
assignment statement
enables us to model objects
        that have local state.  However, this advantage comes at a price.  Our
        programming language can no longer be interpreted in terms of the
        substitution model of
        <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
        application that we introduced in
        section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:substitution-model"/>.  Moreover, no simple model with
        <QUOTE>nice</QUOTE> mathematical properties can be an adequate framework for
        dealing with objects and assignment in programming languages.

      <TEXT>
        So long as we do not use assignments, two evaluations of the same
        <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
        with the same arguments will produce the same result, so
        that
        <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
        can be viewed as computing mathematical functions.
        Programming without any use of assignments, as we did throughout the

        We can use the substitution model to explain how <SCHEMEINLINE>make_decrementer</SCHEMEINLINE> works.  For instance, let us analyze the evaluation
        of the expression

        <SNIPPET EVAL="yes">

        We first simplify the operator of the combination by substituting <LATEXINLINE>$25$</LATEXINLINE>
        for <SCHEMEINLINE>balance</SCHEMEINLINE> in the body of <SCHEMEINLINE>make-decrementer</SCHEMEINLINE>.  This reduces
        the expression to

        Now we apply the operator by substituting 20 for <SCHEMEINLINE>amount</SCHEMEINLINE> in the

        <QUOTE>the same one</QUOTE> only by modifying one object and then observing
        whether the other object has changed in the same way.  But how can we

        object twice and seeing whether some property of the object differs

        As an example of how this issue arises in programming, consider the
        situation where Peter and Paul have a bank account with <DOLLAR/>100 in
        it.  There is a substantial difference between modeling this as

        <SNIPPET EVAL="yes">
          <REQUIRES>make_account</REQUIRES>
          <SCHEME>
            (define peter-acc (make-account 100))
            (define paul-acc (make-account 100))
          </SCHEME>
          <JAVASCRIPT>
const peter_acc = make_account(100);
const paul_acc = make_account(100);
    </JAVASCRIPT>
        </SNIPPET>

        and modeling it as

        <SNIPPET EVAL="yes">
          <REQUIRES>make_account</REQUIRES>
          <SCHEME>
            (define peter-acc (make-account 100))
            (define paul-acc peter-acc)
          </SCHEME>
          <JAVASCRIPT>
const peter_acc = make_account(100);
const paul_acc = peter_acc;
    </JAVASCRIPT>
        </SNIPPET>
      </TEXT>

      <TEXT>
        In the first situation, the two bank accounts are distinct.
        Transactions made by Peter will not affect Paul<APOS/>s account, and vice
        versa.  In the second situation, however, we have defined 
<SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>paul-acc</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>paul_acc</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
to be <EM>the same thing</EM> as 
<SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>peter-acc</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>peter_acc</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
In effect,
        Peter and Paul now have a joint bank account, and if Peter makes a
        withdrawal from 
<SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>peter-acc</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>peter_acc</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
Paul will observe less money in 
<SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>paul-acc</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>paul_acc</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>.
These two similar but distinct situations can cause
        confusion in building computational models.  With the shared account,
        in particular, it can be especially confusing that there is one object
        (the bank account) that has two different names 
(<SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>peter-acc</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>peter_acc</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
and
<SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>paul-acc</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>paul_acc</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>); 
if we are searching for all the places in our program where 
<SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>paul-acc</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>paul_acc</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
can be changed, we must remember to look also at
        things that change 
<SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>peter-acc</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>peter_acc</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>.<FOOTNOTE>The phenomenon of a
          single computational object being accessed by more than one name is
          known as 
          <INDEX>aliasing</INDEX>
          <EM>aliasing</EM>.  The joint bank account situation illustrates
          a very simple example of an alias.  In section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:mutable-data"/>
          we will see much more complex examples, such as <QUOTE>distinct</QUOTE> compound
          data structures that share parts.  Bugs can occur in our programs if

          we forget that a change to an object may also, as a <QUOTE>side effect,</QUOTE>
          change a <QUOTE>different</QUOTE> object because the two <QUOTE>different</QUOTE> objects
          are actually a single object appearing under different aliases.  These
          so-called <EM>side-effect bugs</EM> are so difficult to locate and to
          analyze that some people have proposed that programming languages be
          designed in such a way as to not allow side effects or aliasing

        With reference to the above remarks on <QUOTE>sameness</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>change,</QUOTE>
        observe that if Peter and Paul could only examine their bank balances,
        and could not perform operations that changed the balance, then the
        issue of whether the two accounts are distinct would be moot.  In
        general, so long as we never modify data objects, we can regard a
        compound data object to be precisely the totality of its pieces.  For
        example, a rational number is determined by giving its numerator and
        its denominator.  But this view is no longer valid in the presence of
        change, where a compound data object has an <QUOTE>identity</QUOTE> that is
        something different from the pieces of which it is composed.  A bank
        account is still <QUOTE>the same</QUOTE> bank account even if we change the
        balance by making a withdrawal; conversely, we could have two
        different bank accounts with the same state information.  This
        complication is a consequence, not of our programming language, but of
        our perception of a bank account as an object.  We do not, for
        example, ordinarily regard a rational number as a changeable object
        with identity, such that we could change the numerator and still have
        <QUOTE>the same</QUOTE> rational number.

      <TEXT>
        In contrast to functional programming, programming that makes
        extensive use of assignment is known as 
        <INDEX>imperative programming</INDEX>
        <INDEX>programming<SUBINDEX>imperative</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
        <EM>imperative
          programming</EM>.  In addition to raising complications about
        computational models, programs written in imperative style are
        susceptible to bugs that cannot occur in functional programs.  For
        example, recall the iterative factorial program from
        section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:recursion-and-iteration"/>:
        <SNIPPET EVAL="yes">
          <EXAMPLE>factorial_example</EXAMPLE>
          <SCHEME>
            (define (factorial n)
            (define (iter product counter)
            (if (&gt; counter n)
            product
            (iter (* counter product)
            (+ counter 1))))
            (iter 1 1))
          </SCHEME>
          <JAVASCRIPT>
function factorial(n) {
   function iter(product,counter) {
      if (counter &gt; n) {
          return product;
      } else {
          return iter(counter*product,
                       counter+1);
      }
   }
   return iter(1,1);
}
          </JAVASCRIPT>
        </SNIPPET>
        Instead of passing arguments in the internal iterative loop, we could
        adopt a more imperative style by using explicit assignment
        to update the values of the variables <SCHEMEINLINE>product</SCHEMEINLINE> and <SCHEMEINLINE>counter</SCHEMEINLINE>:
        <SNIPPET EVAL="yes">
          <EXAMPLE>factorial_example</EXAMPLE>

            <!-- \indcode*{factorial}[with assignment] -->
            (define (factorial n)
            (let ((product 1)
            (counter 1))
            (define (iter)
            (if (&gt; counter n)
            product
            (begin (set! product (* counter product))
            (set! counter (+ counter 1))
            (iter))))
            (iter)))
          </SCHEME>
          <JAVASCRIPT>
function factorial(n) {
   let product = 1;
   let counter = 1;
   function iter() {
      if (counter &gt; n) {
          return product;
      } else {
          product = counter * product;
          counter = counter + 1;
          return iter();
      }
   }
   return iter();
}
          </JAVASCRIPT>

        This does not change the results produced by the program, but it does
        introduce a subtle trap.  How do we decide the order of the assignments?
        As it happens, the program is correct as written.  But
        writing the assignments in the opposite order
        <SNIPPET EVAL="no">
          <SCHEME>
            (set! counter (+ counter 1))
            (set! product (* counter product))
          </SCHEME>
          <JAVASCRIPT>
counter = counter + 1;
product = counter * product;
    </JAVASCRIPT>
        </SNIPPET>
        would have produced a different, incorrect result.
        In general, programming with assignment forces us to
        carefully consider the relative orders of the assignments to make sure
        that each statement is using the correct version of the variables that
        have been changed.  This issue simply does not arise in functional
        programs.<FOOTNOTE>In view of this, it is ironic that introductory programming
          is most often taught in a highly imperative style.  This may be a
          vestige of a belief, common throughout the 1960s and 1970s, that
          programs that call
          <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
          must inherently be less efficient than
          programs that perform assignments.

          <INDEX>Steele, Guy Lewis Jr.</INDEX>
          debunks this
          argument.)  Alternatively it may reflect a view that step-by-step
          assignment is easier for beginners to visualize than
          <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
          call.
          Whatever the reason, it often saddles beginning programmers with
          <QUOTE>should I set this variable before or after that one</QUOTE> concerns that can
          complicate programming and obscure the important ideas.</FOOTNOTE>

        The complexity of imperative programs becomes even worse if we
        consider applications in which several processes execute concurrently.  We
        will return to this in section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:time-is-of-the-essence"/>.
        First, however, we will address the issue of providing a computational
        model for expressions that involve assignment, and explore the uses of
        objects with local state in designing simulations.

        never specified the order in which the subexpressions should be
