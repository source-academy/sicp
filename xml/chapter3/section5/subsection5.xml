    As we saw in section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:benefits-of-assignment"/>, one of the
    major benefits of introducing assignment is that we can increase the
    modularity of our systems by encapsulating, or <QUOTE>hiding,</QUOTE> parts of
    the state of a large system within local variables.  Stream models can
    provide an equivalent modularity without the use of assignment.  As an

    which we examined in section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:benefits-of-assignment"/>, from a

    of a random-number generator from programs that used random numbers.

    Let us now return to the issues of objects and state that were raised
    at the beginning of this chapter and examine them in a new light.  We
    introduced assignment and mutable objects to provide a mechanism for
    modular construction of programs that model systems with state.
    We constructed computational
    objects with local state variables and used assignment to modify these
    variables.  We modeled the temporal behavior of the objects in the
    world by the temporal behavior of the corresponding computational
    objects.
  </TEXT>

  <TEXT>
    Now we have seen that streams provide an alternative way to model
    objects with local state.  We can model a changing quantity, such as
    the local state of some object, using a stream that represents the
    time history of successive states.  In essence, we represent time
    explicitly, using streams, so that we decouple time in our simulated
    world from the sequence of events that take place during evaluation.
    Indeed, because of the presence of <SCHEMEINLINE>delay</SCHEMEINLINE> there may be little
    relation between simulated time in the model and the order of events
    during the evaluation.
  </TEXT>

  <TEXT>
    In order to contrast these two approaches to modeling, let us
    reconsider the implementation of a <QUOTE>withdrawal processor</QUOTE> that
    <INDEX>bank account<SUBINDEX>stream model</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
    monitors the balance in a bank account.  In
    section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:costs-of-assignment"/> we implemented a simplified
    version of such a processor:

    the user could step back from the interaction and think in terms of
    streams of balances rather than individual transactions, the system

    From the point of view of one part of a complex process, the other
    parts appear to change with time.  They have hidden time-varying local
    state.  If we wish to write programs that model this kind of natural
    decomposition in our world (as we see it from our viewpoint as a part of
    that world) with
    structures in our computer, we make computational objects that are not
    functional<EMDASH/>they must change with time.  We model state with local
    state variables, and we model the changes of state with assignments to
    those variables.  By doing this we make the time of execution of a
    computation model time in the world that we are part of, and thus we
    get <QUOTE>objects</QUOTE> in our computer.

  <TEXT>
    Modeling with objects is powerful and intuitive, largely because this
    matches the perception of interacting with a world of which we are
    part.  However, as we<APOS/>ve seen repeatedly throughout this chapter,
    these models raise thorny problems of constraining the order of events
    and of synchronizing multiple processes.  The possibility of avoiding
    these problems has stimulated the development of

    On the other hand, if we look closely, we can see time-related
    problems creeping into functional models as well.  One particularly
    troublesome area arises when we wish to design interactive systems,
    especially ones that model interactions between independent entities.
    For instance, consider once more the implementation a banking system
    that permits joint bank accounts.  In a conventional system using
    assignment and objects, we would model the fact that Peter and Paul
    share an account by having both Peter and Paul send their transaction
    requests to the same bank-account object, as we saw in
    section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:costs-of-assignment"/>.
    From the stream point of view, where there are no <QUOTE>objects</QUOTE> <EM>per
    se</EM>, we have already indicated that a bank account can be modeled as a
    process that operates on a stream of transaction requests to produce a
    stream of responses.  Accordingly, we could model the fact that Peter
    and Paul have a joint bank account by merging Peter<APOS/>s stream of
    transaction requests with Paul<APOS/>s stream of requests and feeding the
    result to the bank-account stream process, as shown in
    figure<SPACE/><REF NAME="fig:joint-account-stream"/>.

    <INDEX>infinite stream(s)<SUBINDEX>merging</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
    The trouble with this formulation is in the notion of <EM>merge</EM>.  It
    will not do to merge the two streams by simply taking alternately one
    request from Peter and one request from Paul. Suppose Paul accesses
    the account only very rarely.  We could hardly force Peter to wait for
    Paul to access the account before he could issue a second transaction.
    However such a merge is implemented, it must interleave the two
    transaction streams in some way that is constrained by <QUOTE>real
    time</QUOTE> as perceived by Peter and Paul, in the sense that, if Peter and
    Paul meet, they can agree that certain transactions were processed
    before the meeting, and other transactions were processed after the
    meeting.<FOOTNOTE>Observe that, for any two streams, there is in general more than one
    <INDEX>nondeterminism, in behavior of concurrent programs</INDEX>

    acceptable order of interleaving.  Thus, technically, <QUOTE>merge</QUOTE> is a

    function of the inputs.  We already mentioned
    (footnote<SPACE/><REF NAME="foot:nondeterministic"/>) that nondeterminism is
    essential when dealing with concurrency.  The merge relation
    illustrates the same essential nondeterminism, from the functional
    perspective.

    This is precisely the same constraint that we had to deal with in
    section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:nature-of-time"/>, where we found the need to introduce
    explicit synchronization to ensure a <QUOTE>correct</QUOTE> order of events in
    concurrent processing of objects with state.  Thus, in an attempt to
    support the functional style, the need to merge inputs from different
    agents reintroduces the same problems that the functional style was

    We began this chapter with the goal of building computational models
    whose structure matches our perception of the real world we are trying
    to model.  We can model the world as a collection of separate,
    time-bound, interacting objects with state, or we can model the world
    as a single, timeless, stateless unity.  Each view has powerful
    advantages, but neither view alone is completely satisfactory.  A
    grand unification has yet to emerge.<FOOTNOTE>The object model approximates the world by
    dividing it into separate pieces.  The functional model does not
