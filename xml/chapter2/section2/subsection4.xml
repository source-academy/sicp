        This section presents a simple language for drawing
        pictures that illustrates the
        power of data abstraction and closure,
        and also exploits higher-order
        <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
        in
        an essential way.  The language
        is designed to make it easy to experiment with patterns
        such as the ones in figure<SPACE/><REF NAME="fig:sqlimit-designs"/>, which are
        composed of repeated elements that are shifted and
        scaled.<FOOTNOTE>The picture language is based on the language
          <INDEX>Henderson, Peter</INDEX>
          Peter Henderson created to construct
          images like
          <INDEX>Escher, Maurits Cornelis</INDEX>
          M.C. Escher<APOS/>s <QUOTE>Square Limit</QUOTE> woodcut (see <CITATION>Henderson 1982</CITATION>).
          The woodcut incorporates a
          repeated scaled pattern, similar to the arrangements drawn using
          the <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>square-limit</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>square_limit</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
          <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
          in this section.</FOOTNOTE> In this language,
        the data objects being combined
        are represented as
        <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
        rather than as list structure.
        Just as <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>cons</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>pair</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>, which satisfies the
        <INDEX>closure<SUBINDEX>closurepict@closure property of picture-language operations</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
        closure property,
        allowed us to easily build arbitrarily complicated
        list structure, the operations in this language, which also
        satisfy the closure property, allow us to easily build
        arbitrarily complicated patterns.

        When we began our study of programming in
        section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:elements-of-programming"/>, we emphasized the
        importance of describing a language by focusing on the language<APOS/>s
        primitives, its means of combination, and its means of abstraction.
        We<APOS/>ll follow that framework here.

        Part of the elegance of this picture language is that there is
        only one kind of element, called a
        <INDEX>painter(s)</INDEX>
        <EM>painter</EM>.  A painter
        draws an image that is shifted and scaled to fit within a designated
        <INDEX>frame (picture language)</INDEX>
        parallelogram-shaped frame.  For example, there<APOS/>s a primitive painter
        we<APOS/>ll call <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>wave</SCHEMEINLINE> that makes a crude line drawing,</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>heart</JAVASCRIPTINLINE> that makes a heart shape,</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> as

            William Barton Rogers (1804<ENDASH/>1882) was the founder and first president
            of MIT.  A geologist and talented teacher, he taught at William and
            Mary College and at the University of Virginia.  In 1859 he moved to
            Boston, where he had more time for research, worked on a plan
            for establishing a <QUOTE>polytechnic institute,</QUOTE> and served as
            Massachusetts<APOS/>s first State Inspector of Gas Meters.
          <P>
            When MIT was established in 1861, Rogers was elected its first
            president.  Rogers espoused an ideal of <QUOTE>useful learning</QUOTE> that was
            different from the university education of the time, with its
            overemphasis on the classics, which, as he wrote, <QUOTE>stand in the way of
              the broader, higher and more practical instruction and discipline of
              the natural and social sciences.</QUOTE>  This education was likewise to be
            different from narrow trade-school education.  In Rogers<APOS/>s words:
            <BLOCKQUOTE>
              The world-enforced distinction between the practical and the
              scientific worker is utterly futile, and the whole experience of
              modern times has demonstrated its utter worthlessness.
            </BLOCKQUOTE>
          </P>
          <P>
            Rogers served as president of MIT until 1870, when he resigned due to
            ill health.  In 1878 the second president of MIT,
            <INDEX>Runkle, John Daniel</INDEX>
            John Runkle,
            resigned under the pressure of a financial crisis brought on by the
            Panic of 1873 and strain of fighting off attempts by Harvard to take
            over MIT.  Rogers returned to hold the office of president until
            1881.
          </P>
          <P>
            Rogers collapsed and died while addressing MIT<APOS/>s graduating class at
            the commencement exercises of 1882.  Runkle quoted Rogers<APOS/>s last
            words in a memorial address delivered that same year:

                  to mind the beginnings of science.  I remember one hundred and fifty
                  years ago Stephen Hales published a pamphlet on the subject of
                  illuminating gas, in which he stated that his researches had
                  demonstrated that 128 grains of bituminous coal<EMDASH/></QUOTE>

                forward, as if consulting some notes on the table before him, then
                slowly regaining an erect position, threw up his hands, and was
                translated from the scene of his earthly labors and triumphs to <QUOTE>the
                  tomorrow of death,</QUOTE> where the mysteries of life are solved, and the

        To combine images,
        we use various operations that construct new painters
        from given painters.
        For example, the
        <!-- \indcode{beside} -->
        <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>beside</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>beside</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> operation takes two painters and produces a new,
        compound painter that draws the first painter<APOS/>s image in the left half
        of the frame and the second painter<APOS/>s image in the right half of the frame.
        Similarly,
        <!-- \indcode{below} -->
        <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>below</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>stack</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> takes two painters and produces a compound
        painter that draws the first painter<APOS/>s image below the second
        painter<APOS/>s image.
        Some operations transform a single painter to produce
        a new painter.  For example,
        <!-- \indcode{flip-vert} -->
        <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>flip-vert</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>flip_vert</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> takes a painter and
        produces a painter that draws its image upside-down, and
        <!-- \indcode{flip-horiz} -->
        <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>flip-horiz</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>flip_horiz</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> produces a painter that draws the original

        In building up a complex image in this manner we are exploiting the
        fact that painters are closed under the language<APOS/>s means of
        combination.  The <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>beside</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>beside</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> or <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>below</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>stack</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> of two painters is
        itself a painter; therefore, we can use it as an element in making
        more complex painters.  As with building up list structure using <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>cons</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>pair</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>, the closure of our data under the means of combination is
        crucial to the ability to create complex structures while using only a

      <TEXT>
        Once we can combine painters, we would like to be able to abstract
        typical patterns of combining painters.
        We will implement the painter operations as 
        <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>Scheme procedures</SCHEME>
	<JAVASCRIPT>JavaScript functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>.
        This means that we don<APOS/>t need a special abstraction mechanism
        in the picture language:
        Since the means of combination
        are ordinary 
        <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>Scheme procedures</SCHEME>
	<JAVASCRIPT>JavaScript functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>,
	we automatically have the capability
        to do anything with painter operations that we can do with
        <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>.
        For example, we can abstract the pattern in <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>wave4</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>wave4</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> as

        <SNIPPET EXTERNAL_LIBRARY="RUNES">

        In addition to abstracting patterns of combining painters, we can work
        at a higher level, abstracting patterns of combining painter operations.
        That is, we can view the painter operations as elements to manipulate
        and can write means of combination for these elements<EMDASH/><SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
        that
        take painter operations as arguments and create new painter operations.

        For example, <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>flipped-pairs</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>flipped_pairs</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> and <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>square-limit</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>square_limit</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> each
        arrange four copies of a painter<APOS/>s image in a square pattern; they differ
        only in how they orient the copies.
        One way to abstract this pattern of painter combination is with
        the following
        <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>, which takes four one-argument painter operations
        and produces a painter operation that transforms a given
        painter with those four operations and arranges the results in a square.

        We will use coordinates in the unit square (<LATEXINLINE>$0\leq x, y\leq 1$</LATEXINLINE>)

        With each frame, we associate a

        <EM>frame coordinate map</EM>, which
        will be used to shift and scale images to fit the frame.  The map

        works by creating a painter that invokes the original painters
        with respect to frames derived from the argument frame.
        Thus, for example, <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>flip-vert</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>flip_vert</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> doesn<APOS/>t have to know how a painter
        works in order to flip it<EMDASH/>it just has to know how to turn a frame
        upside down:
        The flipped painter just uses the original painter, 
        but in the inverted frame.
      </TEXT>

      <TEXT>
        Painter operations are based on the
        <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
        <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>transform-painter</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>transform_painter</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>, which takes as arguments a painter and
        information on how to transform a frame and
        produces a new painter.  The transformed painter, when called on a frame, 
        transforms the frame and
        calls the original painter on the transformed frame.
        The arguments to <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>transform-painter</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>transform_painter</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> are points (represented as vectors)
        that specify the corners of the new frame:
        When mapped into
        the frame,<SPLITINLINE><JAVASCRIPT><FOOTNOTE>In <JAVASCRIPTINLINE>transform_painter</JAVASCRIPTINLINE>, we make use of a slight extension of the syntax of function definition expressions, compared to section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:lambda"/>: The body of a function definition can be a block, not just a single return expression. Such function definition expressions have the following shape:
              <LATEX>
\[ \texttt{(} \ \textit{parameters}\ \texttt{) => \{}\ \textit{statements}\ \texttt{\}} \]
	      </LATEX>
	</FOOTNOTE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> the first point specifies the new frame<APOS/>s origin
        and the other two specify the ends of its edge vectors.
        Thus, arguments within the
        unit square specify a frame contained within the original frame.

      The picture language exercises some of the critical ideas
      we<APOS/>ve introduced about abstraction with
      <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
      and data.  The
      fundamental data abstractions, painters, are implemented using
        <SPLITINLINE>
          <SCHEME>
            procedural
          </SCHEME>
          <JAVASCRIPT>
            functional
          </JAVASCRIPT>
        </SPLITINLINE>
      representations, which enables the language to
      handle different basic drawing capabilities in a uniform way.  The
      means of combination satisfy the closure property, which permits us to
      easily build up complex designs.  Finally, all the tools for
      abstracting
      <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
      are available to us for abstracting means of
      combination for painters.
      </TEXT>

      <TEXT>
      We have also obtained a glimpse of another crucial idea about
      languages and program design.  This is the approach of
      <INDEX>stratified design</INDEX>
      <INDEX>design, stratified</INDEX>
      <EM>stratified
        design</EM>, the notion that a complex system should be structured as a
      sequence of levels that are described using a sequence of languages.
      Each level is constructed by combining parts that are regarded as
      primitive at that level, and the parts constructed at each level are
      used as primitives at the next level.  The language used at each level
      of a stratified design has primitives, means of combination, and means
      of abstraction appropriate to that level of detail.
      </TEXT>

      <TEXT>
      Stratified design pervades the engineering of complex systems.  For
      example, in computer engineering, resistors and transistors are
      combined (and described using a language of analog circuits) to
      produce parts such as and-gates and or-gates, which form the
      primitives of a language for digital-circuit design.<FOOTNOTE>Section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:circuit-simulator"/> describes one such language.</FOOTNOTE>
      These parts are combined to build
      processors, bus structures, and memory systems, which are in turn
      combined to form computers, using languages appropriate to computer
      architecture.  Computers are combined to form distributed systems,
      using languages appropriate for describing network interconnections,
      and so on.
      </TEXT>

      <TEXT>
      As a tiny example of stratification, our picture language uses
      primitive elements (primitive painters) that 
      specify points and lines to provide the
      shapes of a painter like <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>rogers</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>heart</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>.
      The bulk of our
      description of the picture language focused on combining these
      primitives, using geometric combiners such as <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>beside</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>beside</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> and <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>below</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>stack</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>.  We also worked at a higher level, regarding <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>beside</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>beside</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> and
      <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>below</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>stack</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> as primitives to be manipulated in a language whose
      operations, such as <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>square-of-four</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>square_of_four</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>, capture common patterns of
      combining geometric combiners.
      </TEXT>

      <TEXT>
      <INDEX>robustness</INDEX>
      Stratified design helps make programs <EM>robust</EM>, that is, it makes
      it likely that small changes in a specification will require
      correspondingly small changes in the program.  For instance, suppose
      we wanted to change the image based on <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>wave</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>heart</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> shown in
      Figure<SPACE/><REF NAME="fig:sqlimit-designs"/>.  We could work at the lowest level
      to change the detailed appearance of the <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>wave</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>heart</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> element; we could
      work at the middle level to change the way <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>corner-split</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>corner_split</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
      replicates the <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>wave</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>wave</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>; we could work at the highest level to
      change how <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>square-limit</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>square_limit</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> arranges the four copies of the corner.
      In general, each level of a stratified design provides a different
      vocabulary for expressing the characteristics of the system, and a
      different kind of ability to change it.
