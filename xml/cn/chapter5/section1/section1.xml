    To design a register machine, we must design its <EM>data paths</EM>
    (registers and operations) and the <EM>controller</EM> that sequences
    these operations.  To illustrate the design of a simple register
    machine, let us examine Euclid<APOS></APOS>s Algorithm, which is used to compute
    <INDEX><USE>gcd</USE><SUBINDEX>register machine for<OPEN></OPEN></SUBINDEX></INDEX>
    the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.  As we saw in
    section<SPACE></SPACE><REF NAME="sec:gcd"></REF>,
    <INDEX>Euclid<APOS></APOS>s Algorithm</INDEX>
    Euclid<APOS></APOS>s Algorithm can be
    carried out by an iterative process, as specified by the following
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME>procedure:</SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT>function:</JAVASCRIPT>
      </SPLITINLINE>
    <SNIPPET>

(define (gcd a b)
  (if (= b 0)
      a
      (gcd b (remainder a b))))
      </SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT>
function gcd(a, b) {
    return b === 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}
      </JAVASCRIPT>
    </SNIPPET>

  <TEXT>
    A machine to carry out this algorithm must keep track of two numbers,
    <LATEXINLINE>$a$</LATEXINLINE> and<SPACE></SPACE><LATEXINLINE>$b$</LATEXINLINE>, so let us
    assume that these numbers are stored in two registers with those names. The
    basic operations required are testing whether the contents of register
    <SCHEMEINLINE>b</SCHEMEINLINE> is zero and computing the remainder of the
    contents of register <SCHEMEINLINE>a</SCHEMEINLINE> divided by the contents
    of register <SCHEMEINLINE>b</SCHEMEINLINE>.

    The remainder operation is a complex process, but assume for the moment that
    we have a primitive device that computes remainders. On each cycle of the
    GCD algorithm, the contents of register <SCHEMEINLINE>a</SCHEMEINLINE> must
    be replaced by the contents of register <SCHEMEINLINE>b</SCHEMEINLINE>, and
    the contents of <SCHEMEINLINE>b</SCHEMEINLINE> must be replaced by the
    remainder of the old contents of <SCHEMEINLINE>a</SCHEMEINLINE> divided by
    the old contents of <SCHEMEINLINE>b</SCHEMEINLINE>. It would be convenient
    if these replacements could be done simultaneously, but in our model of
    register machines we will assume that only one register can be assigned a
    new value at each step. To accomplish the replacements, our machine will use
    a third <QUOTE>temporary</QUOTE> register, which we call
    <SCHEMEINLINE>t</SCHEMEINLINE>. (First the remainder will be placed in
    <SCHEMEINLINE>t</SCHEMEINLINE>, then the contents of
    <SCHEMEINLINE>b</SCHEMEINLINE> will be placed in
    <SCHEMEINLINE>a</SCHEMEINLINE>, and finally the remainder stored in
    <SCHEMEINLINE>t</SCHEMEINLINE> will be placed in
    <SCHEMEINLINE>b</SCHEMEINLINE>.)

    We can illustrate the registers and operations required for this
    machine by using the
    <INDEX>data paths for register machine<SUBINDEX>data-path diagram</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
    <INDEX>register machine<SUBINDEX>data-path diagram</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
    data-path diagram shown in
    figure<SPACE></SPACE><REF NAME="fig:gcd-machine"></REF>.  In this
    diagram, the registers (<SCHEMEINLINE>a</SCHEMEINLINE>,
    <SCHEMEINLINE>b</SCHEMEINLINE>, and <SCHEMEINLINE>t</SCHEMEINLINE>) are
    represented by rectangles.  Each way to assign a value to a register is
    indicated by an arrow with <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>an <SCHEMEINLINE>X</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>a button<EMDASH></EMDASH>drawn as <LATEXINLINE>$\otimes$</LATEXINLINE><EMDASH></EMDASH></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> behind the 
    head, pointing from the source of data to the register.  
    <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>We can think of the <SCHEMEINLINE>X</SCHEMEINLINE> as a button that, when pushed,</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>When pushed, the button</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> allows
    the value at the source to <QUOTE>flow</QUOTE> into the designated register.
    The label next to each button is the name we will use to refer to the
    button.  The names are arbitrary, and can be chosen to have mnemonic value
    (for example, <SCHEMEINLINE>a&lt;-b</SCHEMEINLINE> denotes pushing the
    button that assigns the contents of register <SCHEMEINLINE>b</SCHEMEINLINE>
    to register <SCHEMEINLINE>a</SCHEMEINLINE>).  The source of data for a
    register can be another register (as in the
    <SCHEMEINLINE>a&lt;-b</SCHEMEINLINE> assignment), an operation result (as in
    the <SCHEMEINLINE>t&lt;-r</SCHEMEINLINE> assignment), or a constant
    (a built-in value that cannot be changed, represented in a data-path
    diagram by a triangle containing the constant).

  <TEXT>
    An operation that computes a value from constants and the contents
    of registers is represented in a data-path diagram by a trapezoid
    containing a name for the operation.  For example, the box marked
    <SCHEMEINLINE>rem</SCHEMEINLINE> in
    figure<SPACE></SPACE><REF NAME="fig:gcd-machine"></REF> represents an operation that
    computes the remainder of the contents of the registers
    <SCHEMEINLINE>a</SCHEMEINLINE> and <SCHEMEINLINE>b</SCHEMEINLINE> to which
    it is attached.  Arrows (without buttons) point from the input registers and
    constants to the box, and arrows connect the operation<APOS></APOS>s output value
    to registers. A test is represented by a circle containing a name for the
    test.  For  example, our GCD machine has an operation that tests whether the
    contents of register <SCHEMEINLINE>b</SCHEMEINLINE> is zero.  A
    <INDEX>test operation in register machine</INDEX>
    <INDEX>register machine<SUBINDEX>test operation</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
    test also has arrows from its input
    registers and constants, but it has no output
    arrows; its value is used by the controller rather than by the data
    paths.  Overall, the data-path diagram shows the registers and
    operations that are required for the machine and how they must be
    connected.  If we view the arrows as wires and the
    <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>X</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><LATEXINLINE>$\otimes$</LATEXINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> buttons as switches, the data-path diagram
    is very like the wiring diagram for a machine that could be constructed
    from electrical components.

    In order for the data paths to actually compute GCDs, the buttons must
    be pushed in the correct sequence.  We will describe this sequence in
    terms of a
    <INDEX>register machine<SUBINDEX>controller diagram</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
    <INDEX>controller for register machine<SUBINDEX>controller diagram</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
    controller diagram, as illustrated in
    figure<SPACE></SPACE><REF NAME="fig:gcd-controller"></REF>.  The elements of the
    controller diagram indicate how the data-path components should be operated.
    The rectangular boxes in the controller diagram identify data-path buttons
    to be pushed, and the arrows describe the sequencing from one step to the
    next.  The diamond in the diagram represents a decision.  One of the two
    sequencing arrows will be followed, depending on the value of the data-path
    test identified in the diamond.  We can interpret the controller in terms
    of a physical analogy: Think of the diagram as a maze in which a marble is
    rolling.  When the marble rolls into a box, it pushes the data-path button
    that is named by the box.  When the marble rolls into a decision node (such
    as the test for
    <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><SCHEMEINLINE>b</SCHEMEINLINE><LATEXINLINE>$\, =0$</LATEXINLINE>), it leaves
    the node on the path determined by the result of the indicated test.
    Taken together, the data paths and the controller completely describe
    a machine for computing GCDs.  We start the controller (the rolling
    marble) at the place marked <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><SCHEMEINLINE>start</SCHEMEINLINE>, after
    placing numbers in registers <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><SCHEMEINLINE>a</SCHEMEINLINE> and
    <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><SCHEMEINLINE>b</SCHEMEINLINE>.  When the controller reaches
    <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><SCHEMEINLINE>done</SCHEMEINLINE>, we will find the value of the GCD in
    register <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><SCHEMEINLINE>a</SCHEMEINLINE>.

    <SOLUTION>
      (Solution by GitHub user escolmebartlebooth)
      In <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>factorial(n)<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></JAVASCRIPTINLINE>, the function
      <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>iter(product, counter)<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></JAVASCRIPTINLINE> is seeded by the
      arguments <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>(1, 1)<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></JAVASCRIPTINLINE> and runs until
      <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>counter &gt; n<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></JAVASCRIPTINLINE>, at which point the product is
      returned. Unlike <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><JVASCRIPTINLINE>gcd(a, b)<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></JVASCRIPTINLINE>, the register
      machine has no need of a temporary register assuming that the correct order of
      register assignment is followed.

      For the data path, we see three registers:
      <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>product<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></JAVASCRIPTINLINE>,
      <JAVASCRIPTINLINE>counter<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></JAVASCRIPTINLINE>, and
      <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>n<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></JAVASCRIPTINLINE>. There are two operations:
      <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>multiply<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></JAVASCRIPTINLINE> and
      <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>plus<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></JAVASCRIPTINLINE> with two assignments.
      There is one test: <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>greater than<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></JAVASCRIPTINLINE>.

      <FIGURE SRC="img_javascript/ex5-1-solution-1.png">
	<LABEL NAME="ex:5-1"></LABEL>
      </FIGURE>

      For the controller, we start by filling the three registers with the desired
      factorial <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>n<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></JAVASCRIPTINLINE> and the value
      <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>1<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></JAVASCRIPTINLINE> (seeding
      <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>product<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></JAVASCRIPTINLINE> and
      <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>counter<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></JAVASCRIPTINLINE>). The function
      <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>iter<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></JAVASCRIPTINLINE> runs and tests whether
      <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>counter &gt; n<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></JAVASCRIPTINLINE>. If
      <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>counter &lt;= n<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></JAVASCRIPTINLINE>, then
      <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>product<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></JAVASCRIPTINLINE> is updated to
      <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>product * counter<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></JAVASCRIPTINLINE>, followed by counter being
      updated to
      <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>counter + 1<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></JAVASCRIPTINLINE> and the process is repeated until
      <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>counter &gt; n<!-- Error occurred while translating this section --></JAVASCRIPTINLINE>. Once counter is &gt; n, the product
      is
      <!-- Error occurred while translating this section --><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>factorial(n)</JAVASCRIPTINLINE> and can be returned.
