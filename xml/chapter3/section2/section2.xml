    Once we admit assignment into our programming language, such a
    definition is no longer adequate.  In particular,
    section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:costs-of-assignment"/> argued that, in the
    presence of assignment,
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME>
	a variable cannot be considered to be merely a name for 
	a value.  Rather, a variable must somehow designate a
	<QUOTE>place</QUOTE> in which values can be stored.
      </SCHEME>
      <PYTHON>
	a name cannot be considered to be merely
	representing a value.  Rather, a name must somehow designate a
	<QUOTE>place</QUOTE> in which values can be stored.
      </PYTHON>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    In our new model of
    evaluation, these places will be maintained in structures called 
    <INDEX>environment</INDEX>
    <EM>environments</EM>.

    shows a simple environment

    <SCHEMEINLINE>y</SCHEMEINLINE> and <SCHEMEINLINE>x</SCHEMEINLINE> are bound
    in frame I.  The value of <SCHEMEINLINE>x</SCHEMEINLINE> in environment D
    is 3.  The value of <SCHEMEINLINE>x</SCHEMEINLINE> with respect to
    environment B is also 3.  This is determined as follows: We examine the
    first frame in the sequence (frame III) and do not find a binding for
    <SCHEMEINLINE>x</SCHEMEINLINE>, so we proceed to the enclosing environment
    D and find the binding in frame I.  On the other hand, the value of
    <SCHEMEINLINE>x</SCHEMEINLINE> in environment A is 7, because the first
    frame in the sequence (frame II) contains a binding of
    <SCHEMEINLINE>x</SCHEMEINLINE> to 7.  With respect to environment A, the
    binding of <SCHEMEINLINE>x</SCHEMEINLINE> to 7 in frame II is said to 
    <INDEX>shadow a binding</INDEX>
    <EM>shadow</EM> the binding of <SCHEMEINLINE>x</SCHEMEINLINE> to 3 in

    The environment is crucial to the evaluation process, because it determines
    the context in which an expression should be evaluated.  Indeed, one could
    say that expressions in a programming language do not, in themselves, have
    any meaning.  Rather, an expression acquires a meaning only with respect to
    some environment in which it is evaluated.  
    <SPLIT>
      <SCHEME>
	Even the interpretation of an expression as straightforward as
	<SCHEMEINLINE>(+<SPACE/>1<SPACE/>1)</SCHEMEINLINE> depends on an
	understanding that one is operating in a context in which
	<SCHEMEINLINE>+</SCHEMEINLINE> is the symbol for addition. 
      </SCHEME>
      <PYTHON>
	Even the interpretation of an expression as straightforward as
	<PYTHONINLINE>display(1)</PYTHONINLINE> depends on an
	understanding that one is operating in a context in which the name
	<SCHEMEINLINE>display</SCHEMEINLINE> refers to the primitive function
	that displays a value.
      </PYTHON>
    </SPLIT>
    Thus, in our model of evaluation we will always speak of evaluating an
    expression with respect to some environment.  To describe interactions with
    the	interpreter, we will suppose that there is a 
    <INDEX>global environment</INDEX>
    global environment, consisting of a single frame (with no enclosing
    environment) that includes values for the
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME>
	symbols
      </SCHEME>
      <PYTHON>
	names
      </PYTHON>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    associated with the
    primitive
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME>
	procedures.
      </SCHEME>
      <PYTHON>
	functions.
      </PYTHON>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    For example, the idea that
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME>
	<SCHEMEINLINE>+</SCHEMEINLINE> is the symbol for addition is captured
	by saying that the symbol <SCHEMEINLINE>+</SCHEMEINLINE>
      </SCHEME>
      <PYTHON>
	<PYTHONINLINE>display</PYTHONINLINE> is the name for the
	primitive display function is captured by saying that the
	name <PYTHONINLINE>display</PYTHONINLINE>
      </PYTHON>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    is bound in the global environment to the primitive
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME>addition procedure.</SCHEME>
      <PYTHON>display function.</PYTHON>

	Before we evaluate a program, we extend the global

	the names that are declared at the top level of the
