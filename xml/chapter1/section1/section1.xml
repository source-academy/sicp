        A powerful programming language is more than just a means for
        instructing a computer to perform tasks.  The language also serves as
        a framework within which we organize our ideas about processes.  Thus,
        when we describe a language, we should pay particular attention to the
        means that the language provides for combining simple ideas to form
        more complex ideas.  Every powerful language has three mechanisms for
        accomplishing this:
        <UL>
          <LI>
            <B>primitive expressions</B>, which represent the simplest
            entities the language is concerned with,
            <INDEX>primitive expression</INDEX>
          </LI>
          <LI>
            <B>means of combination</B>, by which compound
            elements are built from simpler ones, and
            <INDEX>means of combination</INDEX>
            <INDEX>combination, means of</INDEX>
          </LI>
          <LI>
            <B>means of abstraction</B>, by
            which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.
            <INDEX>means of abstraction</INDEX>
          </LI>
        </UL>

      <TEXT>
            In programming, we deal with two kinds of elements: 
            <INDEX>procedure</INDEX>
            <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
            and
            <INDEX>data</INDEX>
            data. (Later we will discover that they are really not so distinct.)
            Informally, data is <QUOTE>stuff</QUOTE> that we want to manipulate, and
            <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
            are descriptions of the rules for manipulating the data.
            Thus, any powerful programming language should be able to describe
            primitive data and primitive 
            <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
            and should have methods for
            combining and abstracting 
            <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
            and data.

            In this chapter we will deal only with simple
            <INDEX>numerical data</INDEX><INDEX>data<SUBINDEX>numerical</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
            numerical data so that
            we can focus on the rules for building
            <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>.<FOOTNOTE>The
              characterization of numbers as <QUOTE>simple data</QUOTE> 
              is a barefaced bluff.
              In fact, the treatment of numbers is one of the trickiest and most
              confusing aspects of any programming language.  Some typical issues
              involved are these:
              <INDEX>integer(s)</INDEX>
              <INDEX>real number</INDEX>
              <INDEX>number(s)</INDEX>
              <INDEX>integer vs.<SPACE/>real number</INDEX>
	      <SPLIT><SCHEME>
              Some computer systems distinguish <EM>integers</EM>, such as 2, from
              <EM>real numbers</EM>, such as 2.71.  Is the real number 2.00 different
              from the integer 2?
              Are the arithmetic operations used
              for integers the same as the operations used for real numbers?  Does 6
              divided by 2 produce 3, or 3.0?
	      </SCHEME>
	      </SPLIT>
	      How large a number can we represent?
              How many decimal places of accuracy can we represent?
	      <SPLIT><SCHEME>
	      Is the range of
              integers the same as the range of real numbers?
	      </SCHEME></SPLIT>
              <INDEX>numerical analysis</INDEX>
              <INDEX>roundoff error</INDEX>
              <INDEX>truncation error</INDEX>
              Above and beyond
              these questions, of course, lies a collection of issues concerning
              roundoff and truncation errors<EMDASH/>the entire science of numerical
              analysis.  Since our focus in this book is on large-scale program
              design rather than on numerical techniques, we are going to ignore
              these problems.  The numerical examples in this chapter will exhibit
              the usual roundoff behavior that one observes when using arithmetic
              operations that preserve a limited number of decimal places of
              accuracy in noninteger operations.

            In later chapters we will see that
            these same rules allow us to build 
            <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
            to manipulate compound data as well.
