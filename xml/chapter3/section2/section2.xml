      When we introduced compound
      <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
      in chapter<SPACE/>1, we used the
      <INDEX>substitution model of
        <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
        application</INDEX>
      substitution model of evaluation
      (section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:substitution-model"/>) to define what is meant by
      applying a
      <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
      to arguments:

      <UL>
        <LI>To apply a compound
          <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
          to arguments, evaluate the body of the
          <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
          with each formal parameter replaced by the corresponding
          argument.

      Once we admit assignment into our programming language, such a
      definition is no longer adequate.  In particular,
      section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:costs-of-assignment"/> argued that, in the presence of
      assignment, a variable can no longer be considered to be merely a name
      for a value.  Rather, a variable must somehow designate a <QUOTE>place</QUOTE> in
      which values can be stored.  In our new model of evaluation, these
      places will be maintained in structures called 
      <INDEX>environment</INDEX>
      <EM>environments</EM>.

      An environment is a sequence of 
      <INDEX>frame (environment model)</INDEX>
      <EM>frames</EM>.  Each frame is a table
      (possibly empty) of 
      <INDEX>binding</INDEX>
      <EM>bindings</EM>, which associate variable names with
      their corresponding values.  (A single frame may contain at most one
      binding for any variable.)  Each frame also has a pointer to its 
      <INDEX>enclosing environment</INDEX>
      <INDEX>environment<SUBINDEX>enclosing</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
      <EM>
        enclosing environment</EM>, unless, for the purposes of discussion, the
      frame is considered to be 
      <INDEX>global frame</INDEX>
      <INDEX>frame (environment model)<SUBINDEX>global</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
      <EM>global</EM>.  The 
      <INDEX>variable<SUBINDEX>value of</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
      <EM>value of a variable</EM>
      with respect to an environment is the value given by the binding of
      the variable in the first frame in the environment that contains a
      binding for that variable.  If no frame in the sequence specifies a
      binding for the variable, then the variable is said to be 
      <INDEX>unbound variable</INDEX>
      <INDEX>variable<SUBINDEX>unbound</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
      <EM>
        unbound</EM> in the environment.

      Figure<SPACE/><REF NAME="fig:environment-structure"/> shows a simple environment
      structure consisting of three frames, labeled I, II, and III.  In the
      diagram, A, B, C, and D are pointers to environments.  C and D point
      to the same environment.  The variables <SCHEMEINLINE>z</SCHEMEINLINE> and <SCHEMEINLINE>x</SCHEMEINLINE> are bound
      in frame II, while <SCHEMEINLINE>y</SCHEMEINLINE> and <SCHEMEINLINE>x</SCHEMEINLINE> are bound in frame I.  The
      value of <SCHEMEINLINE>x</SCHEMEINLINE> in environment D is 3.  The value of <SCHEMEINLINE>x</SCHEMEINLINE> with
      respect to environment B is also 3.  This is determined as follows: We
      examine the first frame in the sequence (frame III) and do not find a
      binding for <SCHEMEINLINE>x</SCHEMEINLINE>, so we proceed to the enclosing environment D and
      find the binding in frame I.  On the other hand, the value of <SCHEMEINLINE>x</SCHEMEINLINE>
      in environment A is 7, because the first frame in the sequence (frame
      II) contains a binding of <SCHEMEINLINE>x</SCHEMEINLINE> to 7.  With respect to environment
      A, the binding of <SCHEMEINLINE>x</SCHEMEINLINE> to 7 in frame II is said to 
      <INDEX>shadow a binding</INDEX>
      <EM>shadow</EM> the
      binding of <SCHEMEINLINE>x</SCHEMEINLINE> to 3 in frame I.

      The environment is crucial to the evaluation process,
      because it determines the context in which an expression should be
      evaluated.  Indeed, one could say that expressions in a programming
      language do not, in themselves, have any meaning.  Rather, an
      expression acquires a meaning only with respect to some environment in
      which it is evaluated.  
      <SPLIT>
  <SCHEME>
Even the interpretation of an expression as
      straightforward as <SCHEMEINLINE>(+<SPACE/>1<SPACE/>1)</SCHEMEINLINE> depends on an understanding that one
      is operating in a context in which <SCHEMEINLINE>+</SCHEMEINLINE> is the symbol for addition.
      Thus, in our model of evaluation we will always speak of evaluating an
      expression with respect to some environment.  To describe interactions
      with the interpreter, we will suppose that there is a 
      <INDEX>global environment</INDEX>
      global
      environment, consisting of a single frame (with no enclosing
      environment) that includes values for the symbols associated with the
      primitive
      <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>.  
      For example, the idea that <SCHEMEINLINE>+</SCHEMEINLINE> is the
      symbol for addition is captured by saying that the symbol <SCHEMEINLINE>+</SCHEMEINLINE> is
      bound in the global environment to the primitive addition
      <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>.
  </SCHEME>
  <JAVASCRIPT>
      Even the interpretation of an expression as
      straightforward as <JAVASCRIPTINLINE>display(1)</JAVASCRIPTINLINE> depends on an understanding that one
      is operating in a context in which <SCHEMEINLINE>display</SCHEMEINLINE> refers to the primitive function
      that displays a value. Thus, in our model of evaluation we will always speak of evaluating an
      expression with respect to some environment.  To describe interactions
      with the interpreter, we will suppose that there is a 
      <INDEX>program environment</INDEX>
      program
      environment, consisting of a single frame (directly inside the global
      environment) that includes values for the symbols associated with the
      primitive
      <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedures</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>functions</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>.  
      For example, the idea that <SCHEMEINLINE>display</SCHEMEINLINE> is the
      primitive function for displaying a value is captured by saying that the variable 
      <SCHEMEINLINE>display</SCHEMEINLINE> is
      bound in the global environment to the respective primitive 
      <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>procedure</SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT>function</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>.
