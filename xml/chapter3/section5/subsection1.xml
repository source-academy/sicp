    As we saw in
    section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:sequences-conventional-interfaces"/>,
    sequences can serve as standard interfaces for combining program
    modules.  We formulated powerful abstractions for manipulating
    sequences, such as <SCHEMEINLINE>map</SCHEMEINLINE>,
    <SCHEMEINLINE>filter</SCHEMEINLINE>, and
    <SCHEMEINLINE>accumulate</SCHEMEINLINE>, that capture a wide variety of
    operations in a manner that is both succinct and elegant.
  </TEXT>

  <TEXT>
    Unfortunately, if we represent sequences as lists, this elegance is
    bought at the price of severe inefficiency with respect to both the
    time and space required by our computations.
    When we represent manipulations on sequences as transformations
    of lists, our programs must construct and copy data structures (which
    may be huge) at every step of a process.

    To see why this is true, let us compare two programs for computing the
    sum of all the prime numbers in an interval.  The first program is
    written in standard iterative style:<FOOTNOTE>Assume that we have a

    In carrying out the computation, the first program needs to store only
    the sum being accumulated.  In contrast, the filter in the second
    program cannot do any testing until 
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>enumerate-interval</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>enumerate_interval</JAVASCRIPTINLINE>
      </JAVASCRIPT>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    has constructed a complete list of the numbers in the interval.
    The filter generates another list, which in turn is passed to 
    <SCHEMEINLINE>accumulate</SCHEMEINLINE> before being collapsed to form
    a sum.  Such large intermediate storage is not needed by the first program,
    which we can think of as enumerating the interval incrementally, adding
    each prime to the sum as it is generated.
  </TEXT>

  <TEXT>
    The inefficiency in using lists becomes painfully apparent if we use
    the sequence paradigm to compute the second prime in the interval from
    10,000 to 1,000,000 by evaluating the expression
    <SNIPPET EVAL="no">
      <NAME>painfully</NAME>

      <REQUIRES>enumerate_interval</REQUIRES>

    </SNIPPET>
    This expression does find the second prime, but the computational overhead
    is outrageous. We construct a list of almost a million integers, filter
    this list by testing each element for primality, and then ignore almost
    all of the result.  In a more traditional programming style, we would
    interleave the enumeration and the filtering, and stop when we reached
    the second prime.

    Streams are a clever idea that allows one to use sequence
    manipulations without incurring the costs of manipulating sequences as
    lists.  With streams we can achieve the best of both worlds: We can
    formulate programs elegantly as sequence manipulations, while attaining
    the efficiency of incremental computation.  The basic idea is to arrange
    to construct a stream only partially, and to pass the partial
    construction to the program that consumes the stream.  If the consumer
    attempts to access a part of the stream that has not yet been
    <SHRINK_PARAGRAPH lines="1"/>
    constructed, the stream will automatically construct just enough more
    of itself to produce the required part, thus preserving the illusion
    that the entire stream exists.  In other words, although we will write
    programs as if we were processing complete sequences, we design our
    stream implementation to automatically and transparently interleave
    the construction of the stream with its use.

    The special form <SCHEMEINLINE>delay</SCHEMEINLINE> allowed the authors
    of the original version to (1) hide the lambda being constructed, and (2)
    elegantly sneak in the memoization optimization. There are no special forms
    in JavaScript, so the lambda expression in the tail of a stream must be
    explicit. This is not much
    of a loss; streams are somewhat demystified with explicit lambda expressions.
    We decided to <EM>not</EM> use memoization as default, in order to keep
    stream tails in their bare lambda expression simplicity. We mention
    memoization at the end of this section as an optional optimization, and
    refer to this variant in a few exercises in the following sections.

        Thus we can make and use streams, in just the same way as we can make
        and use lists, to represent aggregate data arranged in a sequence.  In
        particular, we can build stream analogs of the list operations from
        chapter<SPACE/><REF NAME="chap:data"></REF>, such as <SCHEMEINLINE>list-ref</SCHEMEINLINE>,
	<SCHEMEINLINE>map</SCHEMEINLINE>, and
	<SCHEMEINLINE>for-each</SCHEMEINLINE>:<FOOTNOTE>This should bother you.
	The fact that we are defining such similar procedures
        for streams and lists indicates that we are missing some
        underlying abstraction.  Unfortunately, in order to exploit this
        abstraction, we will need to exert finer control over the process of
        evaluation than we can at present.  We will discuss this point further
        at the end of

        To make the stream implementation automatically and transparently
        interleave the construction of a stream with its use, we will arrange
        for the <SCHEMEINLINE>cdr</SCHEMEINLINE> of a stream to be evaluated
	when it is accessed by the <SCHEMEINLINE>stream-cdr</SCHEMEINLINE>
	procedure rather than when the stream is constructed by
	<SCHEMEINLINE>cons-stream</SCHEMEINLINE>.  This implementation choice
	is reminiscent of our discussion of rational numbers in
        section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:abstraction-barriers"/>, where we saw
	that we can choose to implement rational numbers so that the reduction
	of numerator and denominator to lowest terms is performed either at
        construction time or at selection time.  The two rational-number
        implementations produce the same data abstraction, but the choice has
        an effect on efficiency.  There is a similar relationship between
        streams and ordinary lists.  As a data abstraction, streams are the
        same as lists.  The difference is the time at which the elements are
        evaluated.  With ordinary lists, both the
	<SCHEMEINLINE>car</SCHEMEINLINE> and the <SCHEMEINLINE>cdr</SCHEMEINLINE>
        are evaluated at construction time.  With streams, the
	<SCHEMEINLINE>cdr</SCHEMEINLINE> is evaluated at selection time.

        What this means is that we will construct streams using pairs.  However,
        rather than placing the value of the rest of the stream
        into the <SCHEMEINLINE>cdr</SCHEMEINLINE> of the
        pair we will put there a promise to compute the rest if it is ever
        requested.  <SCHEMEINLINE>Stream-car</SCHEMEINLINE> and

	Since this is not prime,
        <SCHEMEINLINE>stream-filter</SCHEMEINLINE> examines the

        This result is now passed to <SCHEMEINLINE>stream-cdr</SCHEMEINLINE> in

	the delayed <SCHEMEINLINE>stream-enumerate-interval</SCHEMEINLINE> until

	<SCHEMEINLINE>delay</SCHEMEINLINE> and
	<SCHEMEINLINE>force</SCHEMEINLINE> may seem like mysterious operations,
	their implementation is really quite straightforward.
        <SCHEMEINLINE>Delay</SCHEMEINLINE> must package an expression so that it
	can be evaluated later on demand, and we can accomplish this simply by
	treating the expression as the body of a procedure.
	<SCHEMEINLINE>Delay</SCHEMEINLINE> can be a special form such that
        <SNIPPET EVAL="no">
          <SCHEME>
(delay exp)
          </SCHEME>
        </SNIPPET>

      <TEXT>
        <SCHEMEINLINE>Force</SCHEMEINLINE> simply calls the procedure
        (of no arguments) produced by <SCHEMEINLINE>delay</SCHEMEINLINE>,
	so we can implement <SCHEMEINLINE>force</SCHEMEINLINE> as
        a procedure:
        <SNIPPET>
          <INDEX><DECLARATION>force</DECLARATION></INDEX>

      <TEXT>
        This implementation suffices for <SCHEMEINLINE>delay</SCHEMEINLINE> and
	<SCHEMEINLINE>force</SCHEMEINLINE> to work as advertised, but there is
	an important optimization that we can include.  In many applications, we
	end up forcing the same delayed object many times.  This can lead to
	serious inefficiency in recursive programs involving streams.  (See
        exercise<SPACE/><REF NAME="ex:fib-stream-efficiency"/>.)  The solution
	is to build delayed objects so that the first time they are forced, they
	store the value that is computed.  Subsequent forcings will simply
	return the stored value without repeating the computation.  In other
	words, we implement <SCHEMEINLINE>delay</SCHEMEINLINE> as a
	special-purpose

        <INDEX>memoization<SUBINDEX><ORDER>delay</ORDER>by <SCHEMEINLINE>delay</SCHEMEINLINE></SUBINDEX></INDEX>
	memoized procedure similar to the one described in
	exercise<SPACE/><REF NAME="ex:memoization"/>. One way to accomplish this
	is to use the following procedure, which takes as argument a procedure
        (of no arguments) and returns a memoized version of the procedure. The
	first time the memoized procedure is run, it saves the computed result.
	On subsequent evaluations, it simply returns the result.

	To make the stream implementation automatically and transparently
	interleave the construction of a stream with its use, we have arranged
	for the tail
	of a stream to be evaluated when it is accessed by the
	<JAVASCRIPTINLINE>stream_tail</JAVASCRIPTINLINE>
	function rather than when the stream is constructed by
	<JAVASCRIPTINLINE>pair</JAVASCRIPTINLINE>.
	This implementation choice is reminiscent of our discussion of rational numbers
	in section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:abstraction-barriers"/>, where we saw
	that we can choose to implement rational numbers so that the reduction
	of numerator and denominator to lowest terms is performed either at
        construction time or at selection time.  The two rational-number
        implementations produce the same data abstraction, but the choice has
        an effect on efficiency.  There is a similar relationship between
        streams and ordinary lists.  As a data abstraction, streams are the
        same as lists.  The difference is the time at which the elements are
        evaluated.  With ordinary lists, both the
	<JAVASCRIPTINLINE>head</JAVASCRIPTINLINE> and the
	<JAVASCRIPTINLINE>tail</JAVASCRIPTINLINE>
        are evaluated at construction time.  With streams, the

	When we construct stream pairs, we delay the evaluation of their tail

      <TEXT>
        This implementation suffices for streams to work as advertised, but
	there is an important optimization that we shall consider where needed.
	In many	applications, we end up forcing the same delayed object many
	times. This can lead to serious inefficiency in recursive programs
	involving streams.  (See
	exercise<SPACE/><REF NAME="ex:fib-stream-efficiency"/>.)
	The solution is to build delayed objects so that the first time they are
	forced, they store the value that is computed.  Subsequent forcings will
	simply return the stored value without repeating the computation.  In
	other words, we implement the construction of stream pairs as a
        <INDEX>delayed expression<SUBINDEX>memoized</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
        <INDEX>memoization<SUBINDEX><ORDER>stream tail</ORDER>in stream tail</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
	memoized function similar to the one described in
	exercise<SPACE/><REF NAME="ex:memoization"/>. One way to accomplish this
	is to use the following function, which takes as argument a function
        (of no arguments) and returns a memoized version of the function.
	The first time the memoized function is run, it saves the computed
	result.	On subsequent evaluations, it simply returns
	the result.<FOOTNOTE>There are many possible implementations of streams
	other than the one described in this section.  Delayed evaluation, which
	is the key to making streams practical, was inherent in 
        <INDEX>Algol<SUBINDEX>call-by-name argument passing</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
        Algol 60<APOS/>s
        <INDEX>call-by-name argument passing</INDEX>
	<EM>call-by-name</EM>
        parameter-passing method.  The use of this mechanism to implement
        streams was first described by 
        <INDEX>Landin, Peter</INDEX>
        Landin (1965).  Delayed evaluation for
        streams was introduced into Lisp by 
        <INDEX>Friedman, Daniel P.</INDEX>
        <INDEX>Wise, David S.</INDEX>
        Friedman and Wise (1976). In their
        implementation,
	<SCHEMEINLINE>cons</SCHEMEINLINE> (the Lisp
	equivalent of our
	<JAVASCRIPTINLINE>pair</JAVASCRIPTINLINE> function)
	always delays evaluating its arguments, so
        that lists automatically behave as streams.  The memoizing
        optimization is also known as 
        <INDEX>call-by-need argument passing</INDEX>
        <EM>call-by-need</EM>.  The Algol community would refer to our original
