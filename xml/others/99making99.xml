      The JavaScript adaptation of SICP is an open-source community effort.
      The software and data required for making these web pages and the PDF edition are contained
      in the github repository
      <LINK address="https://github.com/source-academy/sicp">Source Academy / sicp</LINK>,
      and improvements, extensions and discussions are handled in this repository using <TT>git</TT>.

      Martin Henz started translating SICP to JavaScript in 2008. He obtained the original
      <LaTeX/><SPACE/>sources of the second edition from Gerald Jay Sussman, and converted them to
      a custom-built XML format. The original sources are retained in the XML format, which
      allows for a 
      <LINK address="https://sicp.sourceacademy.org/split">comparison edition</LINK>.
      A processing system written in XSLT resulted in the
      first version of the JavaScript adaptation around 2009, covering the first few sections of SICP.
      The content of SICP JS contained in the
      XML files are undergoing continuous improvement by the adapters Martin Henz and Tobias
      Wrigstad, and by the community of SICP JS readers, using the github repository.

    <TEXT>
      In the book, program fragments often require other program fragments.
      In order to collect and execute the necessary programs, the corresponding
      <TT>SNIPPET</TT> tags in the xml files include <TT>REQUIRES</TT> tags. The 
      XML processors use these tags in order to assemble the executable programs.
      The project thus can be seen as a <EM>literate programming system</EM>, custom-made
      for authoring SICP JS.

      was designed and implemented by Samuel Fang
      in 2021. The XML textbook sources are translated to a JSON format, which
      are then read and rendered by a dedicated component of the Source Academy.

    <TEXT>
      The first version of the
      <LINK address="https://sicp.sourceacademy.org/">mobile-friendly web edition</LINK>
      of SICP JS was designed and implemented by Liu Hang
      in 2017. Feng Piaopiao improved the system in 2018, and He Xinyue and Wang Qian in 2020.
      Formulas are retained in the resulting HTML files
      and are typeset by the reader's browser on the fly, using the MathJax system.

    <NAME>PDF Edition</NAME>
    </SUBHEADING>
    
    <TEXT>
      The first version of the
      <LINK address="https://sicp.sourceacademy.org/sicpjs.pdf">PDF edition</LINK>
      of SICP JS was designed and implemented by Chan Ger Hean in 2019, using Node.js for
      generating <LaTeX/> files from the XML sources.
      The <LaTeX/> files are then typeset using <LaTeX/> and pdfTeX.
      Currently (2021), Tobias Wrigstad and Martin Henz are the main developers of this system.

      The first version of the
      <LINK address="https://sicp.sourceacademy.org/sicpjs.epub">e-book edition</LINK>
      of SICP JS was designed and implemented by Jolyn Tan in 2019, 
      using Node.js for generating <LaTeX/> files from the XML sources.
      The <LaTeX/> files are then processed into the EPUB 3 format using the
      pandoc system. Currently (2021), Martin Henz is the main developer of this system.
