    With the ideas illustrated so far, we can implement any
    <INDEX>iterative process<SUBINDEX>register machine for</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
    iterative
    process by specifying a register machine that has a register
    corresponding to each state variable of the process.  The machine
    repeatedly executes a controller loop, changing the contents
    of the registers, until some termination condition is satisfied.  At
    each point in the controller sequence, the state of the machine
    (representing the state of the iterative process) is completely
    determined by the contents of the registers (the values of the state
    variables).

    recursive processes, however, requires an additional
    mechanism.  Consider the following recursive method for computing
    factorials, which we first examined in
    section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:recursion-and-iteration"/>:
    <SNIPPET>
      <NAME>factorial_5_1_4</NAME>

      <SCHEME>
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 1)
      1
      (* (factorial (- n 1)) n)))
      </SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT>
function factorial(n) {
    return n === 1 
           ? 1
           : n * factorial(n - 1);
}      
      </JAVASCRIPT>
    </SNIPPET>

    As we see from the
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME>procedure,</SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT>function,</JAVASCRIPT>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    computing <LATEXINLINE>$n!$</LATEXINLINE> requires computing
    <LATEXINLINE>$(n-1)!$</LATEXINLINE>.  Our GCD machine, modeled on the

    similarly had to compute another GCD.  But there is an important
    difference between the <SCHEMEINLINE>gcd</SCHEMEINLINE>
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME>procedure,</SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT>function,</JAVASCRIPT>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    which reduces the original computation to a new GCD computation, and
    <SCHEMEINLINE>factorial</SCHEMEINLINE>, which requires computing another
    factorial as a subproblem.  In GCD, the answer to the new GCD computation is
    the answer to the original problem.  To compute the next GCD, we simply
    place the new arguments in the input registers of the GCD machine and reuse
    the machine<APOS/>s data paths by executing the same controller sequence.
    When the machine is finished solving the final GCD problem, it has completed
    the entire computation.
  </TEXT>

  <TEXT>
    In the case of factorial (or any recursive process) the answer to the
    new factorial subproblem is not the answer to the original problem.
    The value obtained for <LATEXINLINE>$(n-1)!$</LATEXINLINE> must be
    multiplied by <LATEXINLINE>$n$</LATEXINLINE> to get the final answer.  If
    we try to imitate the GCD design, and solve the factorial subproblem by
    decrementing the <SCHEMEINLINE>n</SCHEMEINLINE> register and rerunning the
    factorial machine, we will no longer have available the old value of
    <SCHEMEINLINE>n</SCHEMEINLINE> by which to multiply the result.  We thus
    need a second factorial machine to work on the subproblem.  This second
    factorial computation itself has a factorial subproblem, which
    requires a third factorial machine, and so on.  Since each factorial
    machine contains another factorial machine within it, the total
    machine contains an infinite nest of similar machines and hence cannot
    be constructed from a fixed, finite number of parts.
  </TEXT>

  <TEXT>
    Nevertheless, we can implement the factorial process as a register
    machine if we can arrange to use the same components for each nested
    instance of the machine.  Specifically, the machine that computes
    <LATEXINLINE>$n!$</LATEXINLINE>
    should use the same components to work on the subproblem of computing
    <LATEXINLINE>$(n-1)!$</LATEXINLINE>, on the subproblem for
    <LATEXINLINE>$(n-2)!$</LATEXINLINE>, and so on.  This is
    plausible because, although the factorial process dictates that an
    unbounded number of copies of the same machine are needed to perform a
    computation, only one of these copies needs to be active at any given
    time.  When the machine encounters a recursive subproblem, it can
    suspend work on the main problem, reuse the same physical parts to
    work on the subproblem, then continue the suspended computation.
  </TEXT>

  <TEXT>
    In the subproblem, the contents of the registers will be different
    than they were in the main problem. (In this case the
    <SCHEMEINLINE>n</SCHEMEINLINE> register is decremented.)  In order to be
    able to continue the suspended computation, the machine must save the
    contents of any registers that will be needed after the subproblem is
    solved so that these can be restored to continue the suspended computation.
    In the case of factorial, we will save the old value of
    <SCHEMEINLINE>n</SCHEMEINLINE>, to be restored when we are finished
    computing the factorial of the decremented <SCHEMEINLINE>n</SCHEMEINLINE>
    register.<FOOTNOTE>One might argue that we don<APOS/>t need to save the old
    <SCHEMEINLINE>n</SCHEMEINLINE>; after we decrement it and solve the
    subproblem, we could simply increment it to recover the old value.  Although
    this strategy works for factorial, it cannot work in general, since the old
    value of a register cannot always be computed from the new one.</FOOTNOTE>
  </TEXT>

  <TEXT>
    Since there is no a priori limit on the depth of nested
    recursive calls, we may need to save an arbitrary number of register
    values.  These values must be restored in the reverse of the order in
    which they were saved, since in a nest of recursions the last
    subproblem to be entered is the first to be finished.  This dictates
    the use of a <EM>stack</EM>, or <QUOTE>last in, first out</QUOTE> data
    structure, to save register values.  We can extend the register-machine
    language to include a stack by adding two kinds of instructions: Values are
    placed
    on the stack using a
    <INDEX>register-machine language<SUBINDEX><USE>save</USE></SUBINDEX></INDEX>
    <INDEX><USE>save</USE> (in register machine)</INDEX>
    <SCHEMEINLINE>save</SCHEMEINLINE> instruction and
    restored from the stack using a
    <INDEX>register-machine language<SUBINDEX><USE>restore</USE></SUBINDEX></INDEX>
    <INDEX><USE>restore</USE> (in register machine)</INDEX>
    <SCHEMEINLINE>restore</SCHEMEINLINE>
    instruction.  After a sequence of values has been
    <SCHEMEINLINE>save</SCHEMEINLINE>d on the stack, a sequence of
    <SCHEMEINLINE>restore</SCHEMEINLINE>s will retrieve these values in reverse
    order.<FOOTNOTE>In section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:storage-allocation"/> we
    will see how to implement a stack in terms of more primitive
    operations.</FOOTNOTE>
  </TEXT>

  <TEXT>
    With the aid of the stack, we can reuse a single copy of the factorial
    machine<APOS/>s data paths for each factorial subproblem.  There is a
    similar design issue in reusing the controller sequence that operates
    the data paths.  To reexecute the factorial computation, the
    controller cannot simply loop back to the beginning, as with
    an iterative process, because after solving the
    <LATEXINLINE>$(n-1)!$</LATEXINLINE> subproblem
    the machine must still multiply the result by
    <LATEXINLINE>$n$</LATEXINLINE>.  The controller
    must suspend its computation of <LATEXINLINE>$n!$</LATEXINLINE>, solve the
    <LATEXINLINE>$(n-1)!$</LATEXINLINE> subproblem,
    then continue its computation of <LATEXINLINE>$n!$</LATEXINLINE>.  This
    view of the factorial computation suggests the use of the subroutine
    mechanism described in section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:subroutines"/>, which
    has the controller use a
    <INDEX><USE>continue</USE> register<SUBINDEX>recursion and</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
    <SCHEMEINLINE>continue</SCHEMEINLINE> register to transfer to the part of
    the sequence that solves a subproblem and then continue where it left off on
    the main problem. We can thus make a factorial subroutine that returns to
    the entry point stored in the <SCHEMEINLINE>continue</SCHEMEINLINE>
    register. Around each subroutine call, we save and restore
    <SCHEMEINLINE>continue</SCHEMEINLINE> just as we do the
    <SCHEMEINLINE>n</SCHEMEINLINE> register, since each <QUOTE>level</QUOTE> of
    the factorial computation will use the same
    <SCHEMEINLINE>continue</SCHEMEINLINE> register. That is, the factorial
    subroutine must put a new value in <SCHEMEINLINE>continue</SCHEMEINLINE>
    when it calls itself for a subproblem, but it will need the old value in
    order to return to the place that called it to solve a subproblem.

    The machine has a stack and three registers, called

    to save registers, <SCHEMEINLINE>rc</SCHEMEINLINE> and
    <SCHEMEINLINE>rn</SCHEMEINLINE> to restore registers).  To operate the
    machine, we put in register <SCHEMEINLINE>n</SCHEMEINLINE> the number whose

    register.  In the controller sequence, <SCHEMEINLINE>n</SCHEMEINLINE> and
    <SCHEMEINLINE>continue</SCHEMEINLINE> are saved before each recursive call
    and restored upon return from the call.  Returning from a call is

    is actually finite except for the stack, which is potentially unbounded.  Any
    particular physical implementation of a stack, however, will be of finite
    size, and this will limit the depth of recursive calls that can be handled
    by the machine.  This implementation of factorial illustrates the general
    strategy for realizing recursive algorithms as ordinary register machines
    augmented by stacks.  When a recursive subproblem is encountered, we save on
    the stack the registers whose current values will be required after the
    subproblem is solved, solve the recursive subproblem, then restore the saved
    registers and continue execution on the main problem.  The
    <SCHEMEINLINE>continue</SCHEMEINLINE> register must always be saved.
    Whether there are other registers that need to be saved depends on the
    particular machine, since not all recursive computations need the original
    values of registers that are modified during solution of the subproblem
    (see exercise<SPACE/><REF NAME="ex:design-reg-machines"/>).

    Just as with factorial, we can implement the recursive Fibonacci
    computation as a register machine with registers
    <SCHEMEINLINE>n</SCHEMEINLINE>, <SCHEMEINLINE>val</SCHEMEINLINE>,
    and <SCHEMEINLINE>continue</SCHEMEINLINE>.  The machine is more complex than
    the one for factorial, because there are two places in the controller
    sequence where we need to perform recursive calls<EMDASH/>once to compute
    Fib<LATEXINLINE>$(n-1)$</LATEXINLINE> and once to compute
    Fib<LATEXINLINE>$(n-2)$</LATEXINLINE>.  To set up for each of these calls,
    we save the registers whose values will be needed later, set the
    <SCHEMEINLINE>n</SCHEMEINLINE>
    register to the number whose Fib we need to compute recursively
    (<LATEXINLINE>$n-1$</LATEXINLINE> or <LATEXINLINE>$n-2$</LATEXINLINE>), and
    assign to <SCHEMEINLINE>continue</SCHEMEINLINE> the entry point in the main
    sequence to which to return (<SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>afterfib-n-1</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>afterfib_n_1</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> or
    <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>afterfib-n-2</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>afterfib_n_2</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>, respectively).  We then go to
    <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>fib-loop</SCHEMEINLINE></SCHEME><JAVASCRIPT><JAVASCRIPTINLINE>fib_loop</JAVASCRIPTINLINE></JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>.  When we return from the
    recursive call, the answer is in <SCHEMEINLINE>val</SCHEMEINLINE>.

    Ben Bitdiddle observes that the Fibonacci machine<APOS/>s controller sequence
    has an extra <SCHEMEINLINE>save</SCHEMEINLINE> and an extra
