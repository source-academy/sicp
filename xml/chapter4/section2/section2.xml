    Now that we have an evaluator expressed as a
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME>Lisp</SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT>JavaScript</JAVASCRIPT>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    program, we can experiment with alternative choices in
    <INDEX>programming language<SUBINDEX>design of</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
    <INDEX>embedded language, language design using</INDEX>
    language design
    simply by modifying the evaluator.  Indeed, new languages are often
    invented by first writing an evaluator that embeds the new language
    within an existing high-level language.  For example, if we wish to
    discuss some aspect of a proposed modification to
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME>Lisp</SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT>JavaScript</JAVASCRIPT>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    with another member of the
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME>Lisp</SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT>JavaScript</JAVASCRIPT>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    community, we can supply an evaluator that embodies
    the change.  The recipient can then experiment with the new
    evaluator and send back comments as further modifications.  Not only
    does the high-level implementation base make it easier to test and
    debug the evaluator; in addition, the embedding enables the designer
    to snarf<FOOTNOTE>Snarf: <QUOTE>To grab, especially a large document or
    file for the purpose of using it either with or without the owner<APOS/>s

    (These definitions were

    from the underlying language, just as our embedded

    Only later (if ever) need the designer go to the trouble of building a
    complete implementation in a low-level language or in hardware.  In
    this section and the next we explore some variations on

    </SPLITINLINE>
    that provide significant additional expressive power.
