    Section<SPACE></SPACE><REF NAME="sec:amb-implementation"></REF> describes the
    implementation of the <SCHEMEINLINE>amb</SCHEMEINLINE> evaluator.  First,
    however, we give some examples of how it can be used.  The advantage of
    nondeterministic programming is that we can suppress the details of how
    search is carried out, thereby
    expressing our programs at a higher level of

    The following puzzle (adapted from

    <CITATION>Dinesman 1968</CITATION>) 
    is typical of a large class of simple logic puzzles:

      The software company
      <INDEX>Gargle</INDEX>
      Gargle is expanding, and Alyssa, Ben, Cy,  Lem, and Louis
      are moving into a row of five private offices in a
      new building. Alyssa does not move into the last office. Ben does not
      move into the first office. Cy takes neither the first nor the last office.
      Lem moves into an office after Ben&apos;s. Louis&apos;s office is not next to
      Cy&apos;s. Cy&apos;s office is not next to Ben&apos;s. Who moves into which office?
      <!-- 
	  Baker    => Alyssa

      Baker, Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith live on different floors of
      an apartment house that contains only five floors.  Baker does not
      live on the top floor.  Cooper does not live on the bottom floor.
      Fletcher does not live on either the top or the bottom floor.  Miller
      lives on a higher floor than does Cooper.  Smith does not live on a

    In the office move problem, how many sets of assignments are
    there of people to offices, both before and after the requirement that
    office assignments be distinct?  It is very inefficient to generate all
    possible assignments of people to offices and then leave it to
    backtracking to eliminate them.  For example, most of the restrictions
    depend on only one or two of the person-office
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME>variables,</SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT>names,</JAVASCRIPT>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    and can thus be imposed before offices have been selected for all the people.

    Programs designed to accept natural language as input usually start by
    attempting to <EM>parse</EM> the input, that is, to match the input
    against some grammatical structure.  For example, we might try to
    recognize simple sentences consisting of an article followed by a noun
    followed by a verb, such as <QUOTE>The cat eats.</QUOTE>  To accomplish
    such an analysis, we must be able to identify the parts of speech of
    individual words.  We could start with some lists that classify various
    words:<FOOTNOTE>Here we use the convention that the first element of each
    list designates the part of speech for the rest of the words in the

    Real natural-language understanding by computer requires an elaborate
    mixture of syntactic analysis and interpretation of meaning.  On the
    other hand, even toy parsers can be useful in supporting flexible
    command languages for programs such as information-retrieval systems.

    <CITATION>Winston 1992</CITATION> discusses computational approaches to
    real language understanding and also the applications of simple grammars
    to command languages.</FOOTNOTE>

    Alyssa P. Hacker is more interested in
    <INDEX>generating sentences</INDEX>
    generating interesting sentences
    than in parsing them.  She reasons that by simply changing the
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME>procedure
      <SCHEMEINLINE>parse-word</SCHEMEINLINE>
      </SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT>function
      <JAVASCRIPTINLINE>parse_word</JAVASCRIPTINLINE>
      </JAVASCRIPT>
    </SPLITINLINE>
    so that it ignores the <QUOTE>input sentence</QUOTE> and instead always
    succeeds and generates an appropriate word, we can use the programs we had
    built for parsing to do generation instead.  Implement Alyssa<APOS></APOS>s idea,
    and show the first half-dozen or so sentences generated.<FOOTNOTE>Although
    Alyssa<APOS></APOS>s idea works just fine (and is surprisingly simple), the
    sentences that it generates are a bit boring<EMDASH></EMDASH>they don<APOS></APOS>t
    sample the possible sentences of this language in a very interesting way.
    In fact, the grammar is highly recursive in many places, and
    Alyssa<APOS></APOS>s technique <QUOTE>falls into</QUOTE> one of these recursions
    and gets stuck.  See exercise<SPACE></SPACE><REF NAME="ex:ramb"></REF> for a way to deal
    with this.</FOOTNOTE>
