    <NAME>Acknowledgments for the JavaScript Adaptation</NAME>

    <TEXT>
      The JavaScript adaptation of Structure and Interpretation of Computer
      Programs (SICP JS) was developed at the National
      University of Singapore (NUS) for the course CS1101S. The course
      was co-taught for six years and counting by Low Kok Lim, whose
      sound pedagogical judgment was crucial for the success of
      the course and this project. The CS1101S teaching team has included many
      School of Computing colleagues and more than 200
      undergraduate student assistants. Their continuous feedback over
      the past nine years allowed us to resolve countless JavaScript-specific
      issues and remove unnecessary complications and yet retain the
      essential features of both SICP and JavaScript.y

      SICP JS is a software project in addition to a book project. We obtained
      the <LaTeX/> book sources from the original authors in 2008.
      An early SICP JS tool chain
      was developed by Liu Hang and refined by Feng Piaopiao. Chan Ger
      Hean developed the first tools for the print edition, based on which Jolyn
      Tan developed the tools for the first e-book edition and He Xinyue and
      Wang Qian repurposed these tools for the current comparison edition.
      Samuel Fang designed and developed the online edition of SICP JS.

      The online edition of SICP JS and CS1101S rely heavily on a software system
      called <EM>Source Academy</EM>, and the JavaScript sublanguages it
      supports are called <EM>Source</EM>. Many dozens of students
      contributed to the Source Academy over the past six years, and
      the system lists them prominently as <QUOTE>Contributors.</QUOTE>
      Since 2020, the students of the NUS course CS4215, Programming
      Language Implementation, contributed several programming language
      implementations that are used in SICP JS: The concurrent version
      of Source used in section 3.4 was developed by Zhengqun Koo and
      Jonathan Chan; the lazy implementation used in section 4.2 was developed
      by Jellouli Ahmed, Ian Kendall Duncan, Cruz Jomari Evangelista and
      Alden Tan; the nondeterministic implementation used in section
      4.3 was developed by Arsalan Cheema and Anubhav; and Daryl Tan
      helped integrate these implementations into the Academy.

      exercises of chapter 4.

      We are grateful to STINT, The Swedish Foundation for
      International Cooperation in Research and Higher Education,
      whose sabbatical program connected Martin and Tobias and allowed
      Tobias to work as a co-teacher of CS1101S and join the SICP JS
      project.

      Finally, we would like to acknowledge the courageous work of the
      committee of ECMAScript 2015, led by Allen Wirfs-Brock. SICP JS
      relies heavily on constant and let declarations and lambda expressions,
      all of which were added to JavaScript with ECMAScript 2015. Those
      additions allowed us to stay close to the original in the presentation
      of the most important ideas of SICP.
