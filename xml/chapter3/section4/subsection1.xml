    On the surface, time seems straightforward.  It
    is an ordering imposed on events.<FOOTNOTE>To quote some graffiti seen
    on a 
    building wall in Cambridge,
    Massachusetts: <QUOTE>Time
    <INDEX>time<SUBINDEX>purpose of</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
    is a device that was invented to keep
    everything from happening at once.</QUOTE></FOOTNOTE>
    For any events <LATEXINLINE>$A$</LATEXINLINE> and
    <LATEXINLINE>$B$</LATEXINLINE>,
    either <LATEXINLINE>$A$</LATEXINLINE> occurs before
    <LATEXINLINE>$B$</LATEXINLINE>,
    <LATEXINLINE>$A$</LATEXINLINE><SPACE/>and
    <LATEXINLINE>$B$</LATEXINLINE> are simultaneous, or
    <LATEXINLINE>$A$</LATEXINLINE> occurs after
    <LATEXINLINE>$B$</LATEXINLINE>.  For instance,
    returning to the bank account example, suppose that Peter withdraws
    <DOLLAR/>10 and Paul withdraws <DOLLAR/>25 from a 
    <INDEX>bank account<SUBINDEX>joint, with concurrent access</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
    joint account that initially
    contains <DOLLAR/>100, leaving <DOLLAR/>65 in the account.  Depending on the
    order of the two withdrawals, the sequence of balances in the account is
    either <LATEXINLINE>$\$100 \rightarrow \$90 \rightarrow\$65$</LATEXINLINE>
    or <LATEXINLINE>$\$100 \rightarrow \$75 \rightarrow\$65$</LATEXINLINE>.
    In a computer implementation of the banking system, this changing
    sequence of balances could be  modeled by successive assignments to
    a variable <SCHEMEINLINE>balance</SCHEMEINLINE>.
  </TEXT>

  <TEXT>
    In complex situations, however, such a view can be problematic.
    Suppose that Peter and Paul, and other people besides, are
    accessing the same bank account through a network of banking machines
    distributed all over the world.  The actual sequence of balances in
    the account will depend critically on the detailed timing of the
    accesses and the details of the communication among the machines.

    This

    indeterminacy in the order of events can pose serious problems in
    the design of concurrent systems.  For instance, suppose that the
    withdrawals made by Peter and Paul are implemented as two separate
    <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>processes</SCHEME>

    If the two

    operate independently, then Peter might test the

    <INDEX><USE>withdraw</USE><SUBINDEX>problems in concurrent system</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
    However, Paul
    might withdraw some funds in between the time that Peter checks the
    balance and the time Peter completes the withdrawal, thus invalidating
    Peter<APOS/>s test.

    Things can be worse still.  Consider the expression

      </SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT>
balance = balance - amount;
      </JAVASCRIPT>
    </SNIPPET>
    executed as part of each withdrawal process.  This consists of three
    steps: (1) accessing the value of the <SCHEMEINLINE>balance</SCHEMEINLINE>
    variable; (2) computing the new balance; (3) setting
    <SCHEMEINLINE>balance</SCHEMEINLINE> to this new value.  If Peter and
    Paul<APOS/>s withdrawals execute this statement concurrently, then the
    two withdrawals might interleave the order in which they access
    <SCHEMEINLINE>balance</SCHEMEINLINE> and set it to the new value.

    </SPLITINLINE>
    depicts
    an order of events where <SCHEMEINLINE>balance</SCHEMEINLINE> starts at 100,
    Peter withdraws 10, Paul withdraws 25, and yet the final value of
    <SCHEMEINLINE>balance</SCHEMEINLINE> is 75.  As shown in the diagram,
    the reason for this anomaly is that Paul<APOS/>s assignment of 75 to
    <SCHEMEINLINE>balance</SCHEMEINLINE> is made under the assumption that
    the value of <SCHEMEINLINE>balance</SCHEMEINLINE> to be decremented is 100.
    That assumption, however, became invalid when Peter changed
    <SCHEMEINLINE>balance</SCHEMEINLINE> to 90.  This is a catastrophic
    failure for the banking system, because the total amount of money in the
    system is not conserved.  Before the transactions, the total amount of
    money was <DOLLAR/>100.  Afterwards, Peter has <DOLLAR/>10, Paul has
    <DOLLAR/>25, and the bank has <DOLLAR/>75.<FOOTNOTE>An even worse
    failure for this system could occur if the two

    attempt to change the balance simultaneously, in which case the actual data

    information being written by the two 
    <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>processes</SCHEME>
    <JAVASCRIPT>threads</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>.  
    Most computers have interlocks on
    the primitive memory-write operations, which protect against such
    simultaneous access.  Even this seemingly simple kind of protection,
    however, raises implementation challenges in the design of
    multiprocessing computers, where elaborate 
    <INDEX>cache-coherence protocols</INDEX>
    <EM>cache-coherence</EM>
    protocols are required to ensure that the various processors will
    maintain a consistent view of memory contents, despite the fact that
    data may be replicated (<QUOTE>cached</QUOTE>) among the different
    processors to increase the speed of memory access.</FOOTNOTE>

  <TEXT>
    The above example typifies the subtle bugs that can creep into
    concurrent programs.  The root of this complexity lies in the
    assignments to variables that are shared among the different
    <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>processes</SCHEME>
    <JAVASCRIPT>threads</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>.  
    We already know that we must be careful in writing programs that use
    <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME><SCHEMEINLINE>set!</SCHEMEINLINE>,</SCHEME>
    <JAVASCRIPT>assignment,</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
    because the results of a computation depend on the order in which the
    assignments occur.<FOOTNOTE>The factorial program in
    section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:costs-of-assignment"/> illustrates this for
    a single sequential 
    <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>process</SCHEME>
    <JAVASCRIPT>thread</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>.</FOOTNOTE>
    With concurrent 
    <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>processes</SCHEME>
    <JAVASCRIPT>threads</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> 
    we must be especially careful about
    assignments, because we may not be able to control the order of the
    assignments made by the different 
    <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>processes</SCHEME>
    <JAVASCRIPT>threads</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>.  
    If several such changes
    might be made concurrently (as with two depositors accessing a joint
    account) we need some way to ensure that our system behaves correctly.
    For example, in the case of withdrawals from a joint bank account, we
    must ensure that money is conserved.
    To make concurrent programs behave correctly, we may have to
    place some restrictions on concurrent execution.

    One possible restriction on concurrency would stipulate that no two
    operations that change any shared state variables can occur at the same
    time.  This is an extremely stringent requirement.  For distributed banking,
    it would require the system designer to ensure that only one transaction
    could proceed at a time. This would be both inefficient and overly
    conservative.  Figure<SPACE/><REF NAME="fig:two-shared-accounts"/> shows
    Peter and Paul sharing a bank account, where Paul has a private account
    as well. The diagram illustrates two withdrawals from the shared account
    (one by Peter and one by Paul) and a deposit to Paul<APOS/>s private
    account.<FOOTNOTE>The columns show the contents of Peter<APOS/>s wallet,
    the joint account (in Bank1), Paul<APOS/>s wallet, and Paul<APOS/>s
    private account (in Bank2), before and after each withdrawal (W) and
    deposit (D). Peter withdraws <DOLLAR/>10 from Bank1; Paul deposits
    <DOLLAR/>5 in Bank2, then withdraws <DOLLAR/>25 from Bank1.</FOOTNOTE>
    The two withdrawals from the shared account must not be concurrent (since
    both access and update the same account), and Paul<APOS/>s deposit and
    withdrawal must not be concurrent (since both access and update the amount
    in Paul<APOS/>s wallet). But there should be no problem permitting
    Paul<APOS/>s deposit to his private account to proceed concurrently with
    Peter<APOS/>s withdrawal from the shared account.

    A less stringent restriction on concurrency would ensure that a
    concurrent system produces the same result as if the 
    <SPLITINLINE><SCHEME>processes</SCHEME>
    <JAVASCRIPT>threads</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE> 
    had run sequentially in some order. There are two important aspects to this
    requirement. First, it does not require the 
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME>processes</SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT>threads</JAVASCRIPT>
    </SPLITINLINE> 
    to actually run sequentially, but only to produce results that are the same
    <EM>as if</EM> they had run sequentially.  For the example in
    figure<SPACE/><REF NAME="fig:two-shared-accounts"/>, the designer of the
    bank account system can safely allow Paul<APOS/>s deposit and Peter<APOS/>s
    withdrawal to happen concurrently, because the net result will be the same as
    if the two operations had happened sequentially.  Second, there may be more
    than one possible <QUOTE>correct</QUOTE> result produced by a concurrent
    program, because we require only that the result be the same as for
    <EM>some</EM> sequential order. For example, suppose that Peter and
    Paul<APOS/>s joint account starts out with <DOLLAR/>100, and Peter deposits
    <DOLLAR/>40 while Paul concurrently withdraws half the money in the account.
    Then sequential execution could result in the account balance being either
    <DOLLAR/>70 or <DOLLAR/>90 (see
    exercise<SPACE/><REF NAME="ex:joint-account"/>).<FOOTNOTE>A more formal way
    to express this idea is to say that concurrent programs are inherently 
    <INDEX>nondeterminism, in behavior of concurrent programs</INDEX>
    <EM>nondeterministic</EM>. That is, they are described not by single-valued
    functions, but by functions whose results are sets of possible values.
    In section<SPACE/><REF NAME="sec:nondeterministic-evaluation"/> we will
    study a language for expressing nondeterministic computations.

    There are still weaker requirements for correct execution of concurrent
    programs.  A program for simulating 
    <INDEX>diffusion, simulation of</INDEX>
    diffusion (say, the flow of heat in an object) might consist of a large
    number of 
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME>processes,</SCHEME>
    <JAVASCRIPT>threads,</JAVASCRIPT></SPLITINLINE>
    each one representing a small volume of space, that update their values
    concurrently.  Each 
    <SPLITINLINE>
      <SCHEME>process</SCHEME>
      <JAVASCRIPT>thread</JAVASCRIPT>
    </SPLITINLINE> 
    repeatedly changes its value to the average of its own value and its
    neighbors<APOS/> values. This algorithm converges to the right answer
    independent of the order in which the operations are done; there is no
    need for any restrictions on concurrent use of the shared values.
