              One easy way to get started at programming is to examine some typical
              interactions with an interpreter for the Scheme dialect of Lisp.
              Imagine that you are sitting at a computer terminal.  You type an
              <EM>expression</EM>, and the interpreter responds by displaying the result of
              its <EM>evaluating</EM> that expression.

              We have set up the programs shown in blue such that
              you can click on them.
              The mouse click on a Lisp program is 
              programmed in such
              a way that the Lisp interpreter <EM>evaluates</EM> the
              program and displays the resulting value in a box that then
              appears below the program.

              One easy way to get started at programming in JavaScript is 
              to interact with the JavaScript interpreter that is built into
              the browser you are using to view this page.
              <CHANGE>JavaScript programs are called <EM>statements</EM>.

              We have set up the statements shown in blue such that
              you can click on them.
              The mouse click on JavaScript statements is 
              programmed in such
              a way that the JavaScript interpreter <EM>evaluates</EM> the
              statement and displays the resulting value in a box that then
              appears below the statement.
              The program that makes the mouse click
              on a JavaScript statement evaluate the statement is itself
              written in JavaScript; we call it the <EM>script</EM> for
              the mouse click.

              Note that the semicolon indicates to the JavaScript interpreter
              that the expression should be taken as a statement, and thus as
              a complete program. However, JavaScript systems are not strict
              about these semicolons; they can often be left out. In this book,
              we will never leave out these optional semicolons, and point out

              The convention of placing the operator to the left of the operands is

              <EM>prefix notation</EM>, and it may be somewhat confusing at
              first because it departs significantly from the customary mathematical
              convention.  Prefix notation has several advantages, however.  One of
              them is that it can accommodate 
              <INDEX>procedure<SUBINDEX>arbitrary number of arguments</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
              <INDEX>argument(s)<SUBINDEX>arbitrary number of</SUBINDEX></INDEX>
              procedures that may take an arbitrary
              number of arguments, as in the following examples:

              </SNIPPET>

              No ambiguity can arise, because the operator is always the leftmost 
              element and the entire combination is delimited by the
              parentheses.

              that is,
              to have combinations whose elements are themselves

              It follows 
              the mathematical notation that the reader is most
              likely familiar with from school and everyday life.  
              As in mathematics, operator combinations can
              be <EM>nested</EM>, that is, they
              can take arguments that themselves are operator combinations:
              <SNIPPET>
                <JAVASCRIPT>
(3 * 5) + (10 - 6);
                </JAVASCRIPT>
              </SNIPPET>
              As usual, parentheses are used to group the operations together
              in order to avoid ambiguities. JavaScript also follows the usual
              conventions when parentheses are left out; 
              multiplication and division
              bind stronger than 
              addition and subtraction.
              For example,
              <SNIPPET>
                <JAVASCRIPT>
3 * 5 + 10 / 2;
                </JAVASCRIPT>

                </JAVASCRIPT>
              </SNIPPET>
              We say that <JAVASCRIPTINLINE>*</JAVASCRIPTINLINE>
              and <JAVASCRIPTINLINE>/</JAVASCRIPTINLINE>

              and <JAVASCRIPTINLINE>-</JAVASCRIPTINLINE>.
              Sequences of 
              additions and subtractions are read from left to right, as are
              sequences of multiplications and divisions. Thus,

              Even with complex expressions, the interpreter always operates in the
              same basic cycle: It reads an expression from the terminal, 
              evaluates the expression, and prints the result.
              This mode of operation is often expressed by saying that the
              interpreter runs in a
